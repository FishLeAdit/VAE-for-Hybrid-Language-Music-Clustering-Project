But if you leave before I leave, don't let it trouble you much Cause I believe a part of me will go there with you, love And I know a part of you is there inside of my blood So my heart will keep on dancing with you flood after flood Make me a promise when I go You won't lock this body up in a casket Let me grow from the ground So later you can fly around and sing your song in my branches Make me a promise when I go You won't lock this body up in a casket Let me grow from the ground
