Favorite anti-clair would stare, disillusioned, completely unaware of your deviant movement. Foolish, you live a double life, two-sided razor edge of a Swiss blade knife. The bitch made tight, I recognize real, something just ain't right. Off top, belly flop, the intuition of a mall cop. Adolescent, peep you best until your balls drop. All talk, threw my rocks off, barely in junior high. You told tall tales and carried the newest lie. Who am I? A spiritual being, not caught up in material things and clear thinking. Peep me.
