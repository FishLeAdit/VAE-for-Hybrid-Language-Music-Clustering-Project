Yo, yo, like fables, similar to Aesop, when it come to eavesdropping on the truth, is the way you do it no proof, in flowers on improper ill disappear like proof. In a cloud, big up the chest and feel proud for the things that you've done, I'ma tell your sister, I'ma tell your daughter, I'ma tell your son. Continuation of my levical family tree, everybody that is surrounding me, down with me and thus my ancestors is interesting with the rap style, no tester, untester.
