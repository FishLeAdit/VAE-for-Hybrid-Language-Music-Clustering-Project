Mindful intent, reminders embedded in the rhymes I invent The guides I never had, mentors I never found Give as good as I got, I'm giving better now Heading out, been around, here we're gone, now I'm back Where I'm from, come along, might control Impeccable, mysteries, ineffable Every second, double checkin' What you reckon is the best direction Head is on earth, heaven is due Give credit where the credit is due Every minute, we'll spend it, they can kill it
