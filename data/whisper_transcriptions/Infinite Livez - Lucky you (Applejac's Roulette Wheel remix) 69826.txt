I'm looking on the truth, if the way you do it no proof In flowers on it, proper ill disappear like a hoof In a cloud, big up your chest and feel proud For the things you've done I'ma tell your sister, I'ma tell your daughter, I'ma tell your son Continuation of my lyrical family tree Everybody that is surrounding me Down with me and us, my ancestors Is interesting with the rap style Don't test the untestable style But my testicles in your face Smile, jerk Don't let me know
