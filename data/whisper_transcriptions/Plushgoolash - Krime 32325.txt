Slipping away, super sexy to land the sound of sexy. Sharks and leopards, kings and shepherds. Green cake, green cake. Make me pie, a bamboo worm. Kiss my dinner, eat the world. Walk at shank, cheese on medicine. Green cake, green cake. Where's my pepper? Who's cool now? Worms on the baby, ears on mice. Clap by the chimneys and judge my thoughts. Green cake, green cake. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
