I can be right in my will because I came from a grave Like a single grass blade This my time to shine but one day I will fade For now I gotta wrap it Stop the world, don't forget it Don't undo it, don't forget it Or one day I will regret it I live it cause I love it And I love it cause I live it I'm doing it now so I can say that I did it We be getting respect, we be getting paper We be getting stronger, we're doing it major
