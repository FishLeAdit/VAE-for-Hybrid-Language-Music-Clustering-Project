Curble vapour rips out your chest box Sipping liquid cough drops Eyes like cyclops, double drops Trouble is I've not pill popped Still, got a lot to get through to get my fill Roll the popper don't spill We got the crop to put you with the standstill Man can you chill with a few puffs Plus a pint of heavy anvil See the skill won't be stopped by the bevy Then goes a roundy roddy I see he's gone and got the next round already By now he should be getting heady But I'm still rocking steady, what you having?
