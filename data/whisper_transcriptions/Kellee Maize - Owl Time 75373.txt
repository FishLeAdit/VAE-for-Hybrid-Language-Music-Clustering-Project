Crazy witch, don't let a me spit Who do you think you are and who did you come with? Turns out I got a whole squad, owls on my side The nocturnal tribe, we'd rather walk instead of riding For the ground beneath our feet, we marching in the street Awakening fears on blast so we could delete, complete Quit the past, we're belong, we are from one home She got Gaia, mother earth, and the planet's prone To be unforgiving and penal change How we're living in your being, what you're seeing Can't be deceiving, but we're responsible for what we're streaming Out of transmission towers that we call brains Our electric car, more powerful than fame So send out love and say, ooh, after your name Where my owl is?
