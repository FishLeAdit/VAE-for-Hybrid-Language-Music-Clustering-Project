I was crying out, but I never thought this would help An ocean of leaves as I drown as I breathe The skin of these trees holds no oxygen Like medium waves talking to the island Seek me tasting what that would be for now My arms keeps the sky as I'm all in the earth While I run some food through which rocks me From matchbacks and throcks missing places And heartaches lose my mind
