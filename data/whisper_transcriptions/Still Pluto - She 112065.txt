You can be your top, love the way you look at me In the midnight hour, you're the one I'm team You're the one I can't believe You can be your best, you can be your hell You can be my beauty queen You can make me smile, you can make me wild You can be my everything Cause you're my rock and you're my world And I say it's about the start
