Anyone can get locked up, even if they fnick up some BRG rollers. I rock a show in a raw Mark White T toe up, cause it's hip hop. When we roll up, the broken, the forlorn, unite in a fight with war horns, blaring through other speakers as we walk on. Just speak your mind, player. Just speak your mind, player. We losing time, player. We losing time, player. Just speak your mind, player. Just speak your mind, player. We losing time, player. It's more than a game.
