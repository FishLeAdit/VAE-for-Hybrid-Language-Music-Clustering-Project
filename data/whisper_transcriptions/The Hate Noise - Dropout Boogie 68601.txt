My thesis is please, if you believe in a Jesus, take me out of this place before my head becomes a plastic prop thesis. In the back of the classes, we'll repast my time, like a cool kid, scrolling out my asshole rhymes. Welcome to the back of the class, we're glad to have you. We are the frat dudes who love Dave Matthews. Actually, I was gonna learn in this class, but I'm bored of my morons at every turn of the path. Drop out, drop out. So think of wasting away in my education. Drop out, drop out with me. Drop out, drop out. Sorry, Professor.
