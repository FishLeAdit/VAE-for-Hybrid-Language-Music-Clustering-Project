I try to compose myself as the summer sun sets And I notice your sling backs and notice the sweat Drippin' down your brow, come on sugar, sugar Let me show you how I take you back to yesterday I see your eyes talkin' and I hear the words they say Eyes talkin' and I hear the words they say Today is yesterday Let's do it again Baby said yesterday Today So such a lovely day I said let's kick back Let's do it again
