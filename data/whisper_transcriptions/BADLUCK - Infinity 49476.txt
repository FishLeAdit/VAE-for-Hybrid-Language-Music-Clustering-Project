Stratosphere, looking debonair, shit you never wear The boy hard get cold like Delaware I let the vet stop, if you don't see the picture clear Then you scared to connect dots My respect got over the rooftop All because of all of the juice drop, who's hot I put it down like the pound in the late 80s So the flow and the sound will remain crazy Work the mama, my life, hot life, drama, gangsta First stop is the moon, second is Mars First stop is the destination of stars
