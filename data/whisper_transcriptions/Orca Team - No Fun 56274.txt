How could you think I'd want things this way? But I guess you never listen or show respect anyway And since you live around the house and you look like pretty men I don't want you going down on me, I'm leaving you head And I'm leaving you on up until there's nothing to defect And I'm looking for some play cause you're a horrible friend And I'm leaving you
