I took off my necklace and I placed it on my desk by a book I didn't look to pay attention to survey the scene Cause putting it on and taking it off was just a daily routine Since I was 13 I rocked a cross on the chest It made me feel like I was special when I wasn't the best Cheered me up when I was stressed, I never would have guessed I would have had to live without it I assumed for the rest Of my life it would be with me, so I didn't notice Well it was when I got in the car Because my focus was on taking back a movie Then I had to buy a book for a movie
