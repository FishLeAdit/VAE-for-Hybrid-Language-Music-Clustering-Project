During this case, a man was found dead in the middle of Downing Street. Dressed in the finest suits available at that time, although all of his name lapels had been cut out of his clothes.

He was reported to be clutching a thin foil strip of tablets that did not correspond to any medication known at the time. His identity was never ascertained, although the investigation was hindered somewhat.
