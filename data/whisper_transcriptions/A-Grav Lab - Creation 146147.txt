Creation is the purpose of life But human beings think that what we do for others is right We're not seeing with the vision that it takes to enlighten So we'll be fleeing from the earth by the end of the night Disagreeing with the way we lived and the legacy we left A society established upon murder and theft Corruption and greed, the power of disease To claim your turf and rape the earth of all its flowers and trees We live by governmental decrees that don't appease For the way that we contaminate the sky and the sea We're multiplying with these cause we're in total control Of what lives, what dies, and what land gets stole
