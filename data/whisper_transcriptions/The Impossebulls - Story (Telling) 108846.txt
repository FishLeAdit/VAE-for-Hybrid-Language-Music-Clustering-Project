See Doc, what a story to tell, yeah Take you back to 88, 89 About the time that I sat down to write my first rhyme In my mind, now I'm thinking I've got the ill design And my words were gonna flow like wine But it was whack, homie Didn't matter, kept going Spitting over any kind of beats Kept practicing my flow and rolling to the record spot Grabbed the singles on cassette With the instrumental on the B-side Now I'm jetting back to my room pen Hits the paper, graduated to the pause, mixed tapes Gonna make something great
