Now is it wrong to be intimate on the first night? Yo, I guess cause she started shedding tears on my chest Then the emotions stopped before I met my climax I asked her what's wrong, she said you know this is wrong I'm not your hood, right? I said I'm scrapped with my gym hot Wrong words, with no hesitation Started putting on her clothes Headed to the front door, she said I'm not your whore Now why am I feeling this way? I'm used to playing tricks like at my cart And sending them on they way But sometimes I'm not your whore
