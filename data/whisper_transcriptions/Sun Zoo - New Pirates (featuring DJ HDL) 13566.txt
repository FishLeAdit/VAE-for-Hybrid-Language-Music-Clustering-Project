When instead of buy your CDs, everybody goes to the net. R-R-A-A piss like they know it's a threat. And flip out so hard they'll have to get new bridges. Cause some 13-year-old stole from rich musicians. I got a tip if you're listening. Maybe if half the album's coming out, the industry was shitty. Then maybe people spend what you ask for a CD. Don't blame the internet cause you bitches get greedy. It looks in your hand every single day. There's no words that you feel for me. If you believe in the start.
