It's just that I like to shit before I go. You like to shit before you go to the dentist? Yeah. I like to shit before I go out. I was actually just going to go for a shit when you rang. What, in the car? No. In my house. Or beside the car. And then when you rang, it went back in. It was just working its way out to the hall, and you fucking rang, and then it went, whoop, there you go. What's that shit alarm? No, that's the alarm to say, it's time to go. What? What?
