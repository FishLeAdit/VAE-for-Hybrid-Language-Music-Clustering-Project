The one who called his merry men, he bade them with him gold, And he bound them near a word to say, and near a horn to blow. But among Lord Arlings, the merry men were those who wished no ill. The bravest one, he blew a blast, a blast so loud, so shrill. What's this, what's this pride, the little merry groans, a horn to blow.
