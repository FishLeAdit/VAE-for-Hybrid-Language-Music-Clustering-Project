We have anything to say I am sorry What? Yeah Stepped on the scene, lookin' clean Pants, creased, collar, iron shoes, sway Black tie and I made it I got it in the politics that make me behave So I'm a thotic, I'm melodic when I enter the stage Make a project and record it, take a song that's distorted All in order to preserve a beat performance I speak in terms while the beats enormous Clean the towel, I pizza hearted, I put your visa on it We're priests to peace, they try to keep us warm
