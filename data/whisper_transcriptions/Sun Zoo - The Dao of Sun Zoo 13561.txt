Respect it, it's that next shit, the rhythm and time To what I've spitting around, take a minute to find The slinkiest rhyme to bang in his face To make sure you can feel the track like a slap to the face So while your feet's tapping in place, you need to get up Scream it at the top of your lungs, put your head up Don't even tell me you can't dance, I can't rap And three albums later, I'm saying you can't chance Not to do what you want or do what you need If you love music, then move to the beat Whether you nod your head or you groove with your feet Just let it go and let the music choose your technique
