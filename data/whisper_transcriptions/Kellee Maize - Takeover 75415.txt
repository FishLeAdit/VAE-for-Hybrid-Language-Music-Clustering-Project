They need us to make right their name, release the words that say that you are not perfect and powerful. You know we need you just like I need my breath. You make us see right through to our ocean's depth. And when you leave me, it feels like my own death. We are together, it's forever. We are a team of friends. The clock ain't ticking, the world's transformed. Now see it with me, you have been warned. Take over it.
