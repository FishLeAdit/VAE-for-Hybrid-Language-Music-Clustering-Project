Just ain't fucking the hens who ain't laying eggs and the feds are getting policed Martial law in the streets and the ethanol make it bubble in the belly of the beast And the public are obsolete cause there ain't no profit in peace We gotta treat each other with some respect and don't cheat Live, laugh, work, eat shit and die How you gonna know if you ain't giving it a try? Downton Thomas is one of the nine but they feel it It's life, it don't have to make sense to believe it Leave it, you either give a shit or you eat it The system's a motherfucker, I'm joining it to beat it
