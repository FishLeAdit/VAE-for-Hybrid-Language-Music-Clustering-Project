I have a home, selling my home for another loan Beat up, smacked down, left out in the cold Brother get fucked up, they'll do what I'm told Oh, pushing so hard on a giant weight Feels like it's just me against the state They've got a wooden box made just for me To lie down in for eternity No one's game for you this time Send the world on fire
