I'm back to do it again, I'm back I gotta make more, I can't leave this game until the case closes I gotta settle with being genius Amongst pricks that insult my intelligence With irrelevance, and it feel like I'm still boxed in a room with the elephant I'm a democrat, with the pen and rap Falling off a bit, I gotta pin it back Smell us in the beats, when I'm in the streets Wondering again, when I finna eat Always saying grace, day to day I pray I'm a democrat, I'm a democrat, I'm a democrat
