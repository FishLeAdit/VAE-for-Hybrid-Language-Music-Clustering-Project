Old furniture in clothes, contents of floors, pictures on the walls, everything became still. Nothing aged nor was renewed. All the furniture came from Corvus, dated and dusty by degrees. The other room, the old, old drawer. The truth is, school for my life is our grandest of big dust. I am untouched since, my mother's hand, unable anymore. I am untouched, my Lord, with me back in the torn its love.
