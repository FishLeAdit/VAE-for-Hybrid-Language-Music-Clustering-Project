Workbook the defense and perk Get me in your little purse And you'll see how it works Life is like an orange You can peel a slice when you taste it You wanna squeeze it right when you face it You wanna break the ice Like two turntables when I touch the mic You get the picture, go ahead grab a cup It's a picnic, take a screw, mix it up If you want to break the ice
