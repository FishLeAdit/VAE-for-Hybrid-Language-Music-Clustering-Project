We would dance forever under the devil's face, oh eyes Dancing with the devil in his endless fire There will be a refuge where the souls we love market Into the depths of each new mirror Guys and shadows on our children People watch them, they berate and laugh as they do smile There's no one's left to watch you may end When the dust is covered in dark The death of youth will chuck around the D.K.
