I'm just a dirty white boy. Dirty white boy, dirty white boy, dirty white boy, dirty white boy, dirty white boy. I've been in trouble since I don't know when. I'm in trouble now, and I know somehow I'll find trouble again. I'm a loner, but I'm never alone. Every night, I get one step closer to the danger zone. Cause
