On the spaceship, and you gon' say shit Telepath coordinates, leaving all the racists Fuck all of your faces, stay here with the planets Now they wanna race, everybody take your places Okay, fine, bring them anyway Transform their brains when we press play And this time unblind, no child left behind No memories will rewind through this workplace in time May seem morbid, but it's prime You are an orchid of her mind Mother Earth ain't been feeling fine Oi, just trust though we can stall your toy We must only recall our joy No more phony, homogenized boy No more death to little girls and boy Everyone is equal, no chosen horse
