Age 16, remember seeing the tall buildings and how they glean I wanna be here, something dreamy, know what I mean Taking on the world, so full of anxieties A self-medicating girl with big city dreams Flying on the saucer to sat in my moonbeams They thinking I fucked someone to get here, please Hit a 412, I'm finally home, kid Mama's in the factory, I gotta make it big Needle in the arm, a mad people back home No jobs like the city, some spots are war zones
