Facebook, Facebook, I think I lost the plot. Facebook, Facebook, it's the only one I got. There's a drunk out in the alley. I think he's getting sick. The cat's playing with the garbage. I'll have to take a pic. My friends and I once met, drank coffee and ate scones. Now we meet at the cafe and stare down at our phones. We can stop, post a selfie, just hope we're all sitting.
