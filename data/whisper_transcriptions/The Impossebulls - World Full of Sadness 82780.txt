Had it way too good for way too long And all around the world it's still the same song No idea how many lives you touched No idea why it meant so much No idea exactly who I'd be If you were never there to influence me And I loved you cause you loved what you did God speaking directly to kids At least that's how it felt back when I was young Much love as the words jumped from your tongue And filled up spaces I didn't know I had I miss those days like I miss my dad
