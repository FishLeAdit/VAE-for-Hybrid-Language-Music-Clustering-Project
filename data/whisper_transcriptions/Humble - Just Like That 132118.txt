At home, not getting into dirt, putting on mad shows Every time I do a flow, I see you in the front row It's one love, one flesh, one spirit To overcome your loss, take strength and perseverance Perspective gain remains What is nearest, the way I maintain the same What's errant, I carry the burden inside and still bear it Cherish the time we had and we'll share it Caring for my seed, you see what I see Bleed so I believe, teach so I lead Redefine means find peace inside me The soul is with me, always kept intact Lord knows that I wish you hadn't left so fast
