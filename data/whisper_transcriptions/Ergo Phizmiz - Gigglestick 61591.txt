Tonight I'm still like pink sky purple In this bad way to jump in all the hurdles And it's new Pacific Forgot the prescription Bunch of the dick And nothing that you need to chip it Cause I don't know if there's a key My pockets are broke alone Spock a cop on rum That look like it's when the twilight gone I enjoy the fumes Wear it like perfume When I blow half the lip in my dress to come If I dig, I don't know where transition to be We're friends from the past I mean it's to be I'm down Told you niggas should've listened to you Roach up on turn to catch me My soul
