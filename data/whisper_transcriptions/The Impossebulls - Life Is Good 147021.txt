Life's so great cause all I see are all the flaws and the stupid mistakes And all I see are all the problems that's bringing me down Like I've been into a lemon and they spin me around Oh yeah, my son is awesome and my wife is the best But I can't stop feeling like my life is a test That I fail at every turn, get burned and set back Like I couldn't get these vocals quite right on this track Yo, maybe I should stop and listen instead of bitchin' I'd be a rich man if I got paid for nitpickin' I'd see the positives when the glass is half full But I act like a damn fool and damn man, that's not cool Pouring fuel on the fire and stuff
