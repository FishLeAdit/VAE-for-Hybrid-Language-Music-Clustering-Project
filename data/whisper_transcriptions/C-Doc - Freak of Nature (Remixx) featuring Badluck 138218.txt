This massive upset, I'm laughing You can act with a vet, it's a long line No guarantees, baby, love me one time Come on, a cunt, I'm a dog, of course It just depends what kind of rider you want, the kitty And I'm high for blunt, what a good day Hoping it's the same as South Central or Lake Cub This Patron buzz, make me want love You ain't no half-stepping when a thug move Blood move from the subwoofers, I turn down Cuts to turn up, wanna get the word round I'm the man of the house, when she's stepping the doors I'm the man of the house, I'm the man of the house
