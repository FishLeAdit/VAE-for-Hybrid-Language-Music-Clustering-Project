We will dance forever under the devil's face or eyes Dancing with the devil in his endless fire to haste There will be a refuge where the souls we will market Into the depths of these new miracles And shadows on our children People watch them in parades and laugh as they do smile There's more what's left to what you may end When the dust is covered or the dead tributes will jump around The devil's face or the devil's face or the devil's face
