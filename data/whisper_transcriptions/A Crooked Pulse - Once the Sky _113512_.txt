I was crying and now I never thought this would end No sheriff believes this, I tell as I breathe The skin of these trees holds no oxygen Like a million words on the island See what they mean, they sleep with that green deep prayer An arms east of sky, a sign of fear While I answer for the wish, what is mean?
