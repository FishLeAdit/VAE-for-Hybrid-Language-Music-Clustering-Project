Brothers and sisters together there is power in numbers I miss ya whenever we're apart but then It's only temporary cause we'll be together again I consider you fam and you know that's who I am And when we making our plans I know we all gonna stand strong Bringing everyone along for the ride And ever once will I want because someone will provide If it doesn't work out then we brush it aside Cause it's a journey that matters so come along for the ride And my friends are my greatest source of wealth So I gotta thank them all for letting me be myself Get down Get down Get down
