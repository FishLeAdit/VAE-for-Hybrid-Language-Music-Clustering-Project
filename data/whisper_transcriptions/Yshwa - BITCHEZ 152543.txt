When my mouth thinks something done Seems to stumble out I pass her the ball praying Please don't fumble now I think I look ill in my humble crown Never thought I'd see the day that rappers bragging about Soft dicks and coming fast Nothing changed I guess Nice guys still coming last It's just the funk I know you think you smelling something bad Clockwork orange like a Donald Trump summer tan Raised by my mama Ain't ever been a son of man My dad was a cop the whole nine Guns
