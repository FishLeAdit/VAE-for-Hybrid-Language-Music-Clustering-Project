Put your fist in the air Put your fist in the air If it's time for a change Time for a change Gotta tell them hell yeah I see my people standing with their hands in the air With no care on the surface But deep down there they got purpose Living from check to check, a welfare check So do not expect to dissect that All my brothers are pawns While I'm writing from dusk to dawn Just once again it's on I'm on pages and pages with my black king pen The only stat that matters is how much money you spend Before you did it
