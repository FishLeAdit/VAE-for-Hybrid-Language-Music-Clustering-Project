Let us defy
Let us defy

Unite my friends, defy
Heed failure's lesson
And shape our future
Make us transformed
Revolt and smash the shackles
The crisis brings us together
Let us defy

No more deception
There's no safety
Lest you make your own way

Our dreams are what we are inside
And when we close our eyes
We see our future

Their plan will lead you to failure
Embrace this wisdom: let this wash away
And knowledge drives our choices
If we possess, we sustain

No more deception
You must make your own way

Our dreams are what we are inside
And when we close our eyes
We see our future
No longer will we compromise
Our fate is not defined
By right, we choose it

Oh, now we're jaded
Can we come back to one
And find our way
Without giving up our hearts?
Oh, now we're jaded
Can we come back to one
And find our way
Without giving up our hearts?


Our dreams are what we are inside
And when we close our eyes
We see our future
No longer will we compromise
Our fate is not defined
By right, we choose it

Our dreams, our future
(Let us defy, let us defy)
Our dreams, our future
(Let us defy, let us defy)
