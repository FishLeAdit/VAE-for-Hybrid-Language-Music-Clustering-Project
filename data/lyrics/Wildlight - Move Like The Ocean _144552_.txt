Hair like the winter's sun, tall like a ladder
You can ask me what I write I'll keep scribbling
Till you stop your song
Eyes like the ocean you move like jumper
Maybe I can hear your life in every note you play
You're a seastorm, like a wave born
Right before, right before my sight
Fallin' monsoon, let it take you
Right before, right before my sight
There's wisdom in your innocence
Graceful failing into jewels of mistakes
Choosing is your еloquence
A thousand roads and not one right way
Wеar out your welcome, it suits you to stay
With the weight of all your wonderin' you chose
And baby can't look back
Eyes like the ocean you walk like the thunder
