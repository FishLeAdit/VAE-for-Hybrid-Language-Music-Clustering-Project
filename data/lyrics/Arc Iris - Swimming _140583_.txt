Men traveled down winding pathways
Winding through my house
Empty cans dripping their sad days
In their wake I may be lost
One by one, they fade to the distance
Their trails evaporate
Leaving the path they breathed through me
Less clean and true than appears to be
What may strike the curious eye
And then there came the one who is
Swimming through my veins
True and clean was he
That day he drew through my house
The winding winds caught just right
In his wake, the charms at my windows
Whispered temptations at night
His drops mislaid turned to ponds and then lakes
And, through a mist of
Heavy lovers, I am, by a miracle
Drawn at once to an angel
How the weight has shifted, in my eye
Then there came the one who is
Swimming through my veins
He stays with me
