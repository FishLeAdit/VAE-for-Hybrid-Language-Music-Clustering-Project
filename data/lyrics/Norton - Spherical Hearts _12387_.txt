Could it be right, that we walked away
Tumbling on the path, just to end up again
Drumming a new beat kind of pace?
Maybe I was caught in a spinning threat…
Maybe you were tangled in the line of attack
Now I've analyzed all profits and left lovers
Squared roots of memories and other remains
Subtracted a few heart-wrecks and left lovers
All these calculations formed a spherical shape
(Stars)
Now our own destinies are plotting together
Entwining connections on our live hood agendas
I suspect ill be converted into a great believer
If the constellations predict in our sea of years
That you are to be found safe and sound in my arms
