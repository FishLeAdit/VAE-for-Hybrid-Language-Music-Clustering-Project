Her presence fades without
Anticipated doubt
I'll waste the night away with you
I'll waste it through
Her warnings never found
Intoxicated mouths
Are breaking out the night with you
In endless rooms
Incandescent lies for our stale minds
In this place that died you will always find
Your seven days all end the same
Your seven days all end the same
You never drew this out
Fall into covered ground
Interrogate the sound
I'll make it out of here with you
Hide in this truth
Incandescent lies for our stale minds
In this place that died you will always find
Your seven days all end the same
Your seven days all end the same
You never drew this out
How did you make it this far?
How did you guess?
Your losing time with this car
Time to impress
How did you make it this far?
I'm so impressed
