There's a land called France where the naked ladies dance
And the men play drums on the naked ladies' bums
And the way they shake is enough to kill a snake
When the snake is dead, they put roses on his head
When the roses die, they put diamonds in his eyes
When the diamonds break, it's in 1988
And in 1988, everybody's feeling great
'Cause in 1988, everybody learned to skate
There's a land called France where the naked ladies dance
And the men play drums on the naked ladies' bums
And the way they shake is enough to kill a snake
When the snake is dead, they put roses on his head
When the roses die, they put diamonds in his eyes
When the diamonds break, it's in 1988
And in 1988, everybody's feeling great
