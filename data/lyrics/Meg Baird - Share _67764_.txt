You’ve got me so confused
I don’t understand a thing about you
Looking into all the thoughts that live unsaid
Has me desperate just to learn what’s in your head

I wanna know what you’re thinking when you hold my hand
I wanna know what’s going through your mind
When I see your face I crumble down unto my knees
So darling, I’m begging you please
Share your heart with me

I see the past has hurt you bad
Nothing I could say can undo that
Girl I treasure you, I’d risk a world of pain
For a chance that you would say you feel the same
I wanna know what you’re thinking when you hold my hand
I wanna know what’s going through your mind
When I see your face I crumble down unto my knees
So darling, I’m begging you please
Share your heart with me
Share your heart with mе
I wanna know what you’re thinking when you hold my hand
I wanna know what’s going through your mind
When I see your facе I crumble down unto my knees
So darling, I’m begging you please
Share your heart with me
