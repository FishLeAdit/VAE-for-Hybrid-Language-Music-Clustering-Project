Everyone has challenges in their life, every day
Some of them are small
Or some of them are big, massive issues that can make or break you
Or when you're a child, if you're lucky, you've got you parents there to help and support you
But When you become an adult, you have to learn to cope with these things on your own
But we can always support each other
No matter what you're doing right now;
Working, chilling, walking down the street, driving your car, whatever
Listen to my words and hopefully they'll give you some strength
Now I know you can do it, I know I can do it to
Just support me and I'll support you
Not going down without a fight
Not going down without a fight
No way, no way now I'm
Not going down without a fight
Not going down without a fight
In this life
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
No way, no way now
I'm not going down without a fight
Pick myself up then I can reach the highest height
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
No way, no way now
I'm not going down without a fight
Pick myself up then I can reach the highest height
I can do it on my own, even if I'm all alone
I can feel it in my heart, I can feel it in my bones
It won't bring me down
No it won't, no it won't
All I need is food and water and a place to call home
If I take to the sky like a bird on the wind
I deserve better things, even if I have sin
I can make it, gotta lay the foundation
So I can look back and say I never let it break
Not going down without a fight
Not going down without a fight
No way, no way now I'm
Not going down without a fight
Not going down without a fight
In this life
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
No way, no way now
I'm not going down without a fight
Pick myself up then I can reach the highest height
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
I'm not going down without a fight
No way, no way now
I'm not going down without a fight
Pick myself up then I can reach the highest height
You're not going down without a fight
You're not going down without a fight
You're not going down without a fight
You're not going down without a fight
We ain't going down without a fight
