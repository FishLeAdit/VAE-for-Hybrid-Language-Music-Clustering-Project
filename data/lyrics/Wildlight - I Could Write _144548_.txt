I could write broken tables upturned broken china
In my insides broken windows
I could write wrinkled letter
Posted stabbing folded
Yesteryear, holding on
But would it serve you?
And I could write of the dirty corners
Cobwebs still stuck to me
Lacy white and hard to reach
And I could write of a mixed-up morning
Hands upon these shoulders
Heavy, still not knowing
Would it serve you?
How could it serve you?
And in the lines I see a pattern of a rail
And in the dark I see the spiral of a trail
And in the lines I see a pattern of a rail
And in the dark I see the spiral of a trail
Moving, deeper, listen, slowly I fall
Fall… fall… away
And I'd like to write worldly weather
Clouds over these shoulders
Changing getting outta myself
And I'd like to write all that holds you
But cannot quite see into
So come shortened parables
I'd like to turn upon the shadows
Thrust upon them candles
Give 'em to the sun set down
And I'd like to learn from old volcanoes
Spew what we do not need
What we do not, we do not need
What we do not, we do not need
What we do not, do not need
Do not, do not need
Do not, do not like, to write
The silence between what I'd like
And what I'm merely being…
I’d like to write the silence between
What I’d like and what I’m merely being
