The battle has been fought
We've lost some how
The reflection in the mirror
Our guard is down for now
The windows are close
We've lost this fight
The people will fall
With the fall of the night this time
City lights
Drown the night
Broken lights
Sound the night
The city lights have been broken
The darkness sound
The night has grown tired
It's lost its crown for now
The city streets have been sold
They've been shut up
The fortune has been told
It's up to lady luck this time
City lights
Drown the night
Broken lights
Sound the night
