The death bell had been rung
The last song had been sung

Now no amount of power
Ever could replace
The way he said my name
The smile upon his face

Oh, no
Now we'll never dream again
No
Now we'll never dream again
Love for its own sake
Does not a marriage make

But now I can't recall
The reason for our fall

Now no amount of power
Ever could replace
The way he said my name
The look upon his face

Oh, no
Now we'll never dream again
No
Now we'll never dream again
Love for its own sake
Does not a marriage make
