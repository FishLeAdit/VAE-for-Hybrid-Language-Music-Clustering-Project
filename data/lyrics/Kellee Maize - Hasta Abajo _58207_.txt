Welcome ladies and gentleman
A mercedes kinda sentiment
Luxary in trustin me to
Honor the free we all should be
It seems my sundial burst in two
Yin and yang right left me you
I'll build it with no driver or screw
See I did undo all that I know
And You know this and you know that
Please consider your more than what you think you lack
I feel the sorrow and all the pain
Tryna create tomorrow be happy for this day
I'm getting obsessed and feelin a mess
Then I thank goddess remind me I'm blessed
See we're all afraid this is human
Forgettin what you're made of
Thinkin your loosin hit the snooze
And headache from boozing
Know it's you whose chosen' and refusing
The responsibility
It's hard to accept you see
But we are in control
It's your world you chose your role
It's hard it takes a toll
Oh that ego won't let go
Something screamin in your soul
Right there in between your pole
It is the game and not the goal
I love your diamond and your coal

(Eddedededah Ededededah edededehdahdahdah)
We create our own
Your own reality
Everything in the world
Is reflection of the me
Use your energy for something new un-thought
Do what you always did
You'll get what you always got
(Eddedededah Ededededah edededehdahdahdah)
Go with me down
All the way down to the bottom
Where you will, find your crown
Your love your fear and all that is rotten
Go with me down
All the way down to the bottom
Where you will, find your crown
Your love your fear and all that is rotten

Judge me all day, you'll notice
You don't like something now focus
You project from you to me
Reminding you of what you can or can't be
Everyone in your life
That causes the pain and strife
Comes from your perception
Release the mental congestion
Breathe in you have been tested
How will you learn this lesson
Science is now your best friend (Science is Now)
Your struggle could be restin
I cry for all the hungry
I feel their bellies bloat
Before we can make real change
We must release the hope
That something is outside us
That we are not in charge
That others can divide us
That you can not reach the stars

(Eddedededah Ededededah edededehdahdahdah)
We create our own
Your own reality
Everything in the world
Is reflection of the me
Use your energy for something new un-thought
Do what you always did
You'll get what you always got
(Eddedededah Ededededah edededehdahdahdah)
Go with me down
All the way down to the bottom
Where you will, find your crown
Your love your fear and all that is rotten
Go with me down
All the way down to the bottom
Where you will, find your crown
Your love your fear and all that is rotten

A cavern deeply barriers me
The blue drowns me out to sea
And back I come a mermaid
Transformed I'm thirsty
For the love you give and the hate you hold
The way you live how you unfold
Cause I tangle in you create
A knot together we realize
What we have brought
Forensically determine that my
Aura needs reworking
You see my energies uncertain
With my esteem I will be flirting
Into the amethyst I fade
A purple chasm made my way
I am rewriting a new day
And doing everything I say
I will not speak to your smallness
A destruction of the fear in of (You Are Great)
I have yet to know what I should call this
A hybrid of experience

(Eddedededah Ededededah edededehdahdahdah)
We create our own
Your own reality
Everything in the world
Is reflection of the me
Use your energy for something new un-thought
Do what you always did
You'll get what you always got
(Eddedededah Ededededah edededehdahdahdah)
Go with me down
All the way down to the bottom
Where you will, find your crown
Your love your fear and all that is rotten
Go with me down
All the way down to the bottom
Where you will, find your crown
Your love your fear and all that is rotten
