There's a thing with a hook
Pulling doors off cars
Down on lover's lane
Down on lover's lane
There's a thing with a hook
Pulling heads off boyfriends
Down on lover's lane
Down on lover's lane
There's a thing with a hook
Pulling heads off girlfriends
Down on lover's lane
Down on lover's lane
Ten years ago
They cut off his hand
And gave him a hook
And then put him jail for the criminally insane
But now he's back
And went to lover's lane
There's a thing with a hook
Pulling doors off cars
Down on lover's lane
Down on lover's lane
There's a thing with a hook
Pulling heads off boyfriends
Down on lover's lane
Down on lover's lane
There's a thing with a hook
Pulling heads off girlfriends
Down on lover's lane
Down on lover's lane
