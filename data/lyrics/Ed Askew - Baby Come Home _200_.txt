Maybe I'll try another reason
Maybe I'll lie or maybe I'll squeeze him
Maybe I'll die or maybe..
I'll write him a poem

Maybe I'll wait for another season
Maybe I'll cry or maybe I'll seize him
Maybe I'll get drunk
And sing him a song
Baby come home

When I am lonely
I think about it
But I can't cry
And so I'll shout it
I've got to shout it

Maybe I'm running away from here
Maybe I'm dreaming or maybe I really care
Maybe, you know this is like some movie I've seen before
But baby I'd like to see you at my door

Whеn I'm alone
I'd like to see you
And in this song
I say I need you
I really need you

Maybе I'll try another reason
Maybe I'll lie or maybe I'll squeeze him
Maybe I'll die or maybe I'll
Write him a poem
Baby come...
