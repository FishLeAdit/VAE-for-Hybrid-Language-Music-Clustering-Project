Will we ever meet each other ever again?
Will we ever meet each other ever again?
Or is this just the abrupt-

Oh, the heroes of fiction
They've all got
Nothing on you
I felt the pull of attraction
But I held back
Just to make sure
Oh, what seemed like the wrong tact
Became
Circumstantial fact
And now we're separated
I cannot bare to say it

Will we ever meet each other ever again?
Will we ever meet each other ever again?
Or is this just the abrupt-

Oh, how good's being misled
Now we're
Disembodied heads
Longing for connection
We're writhing
But what can we do?
But wonder we missed our shot
Worst trade deal anyone has got
But who am I in anything?
Philosophizing got me saying

Things I might regret
I'm lashing out
Can you look away
I'm not
As good
A thinker
I think I am
Dropping all pretention
I'll just say
"I miss you"

Will we ever meet each other ever again?
Will we ever meet each other ever again?

Oh, the heroes of fiction
(Will we ever meet each other)
They've all got
(Ever)
Nothing on you
(Again)
I felt the pull of attraction
(Will we ever meet each other)
But I held back
(Ever)
Just to make sure
(Again)
Oh, what seemed like the wrong tact
(Will we ever meet each other)
Became circumstantial fact
(Ever again)
And now we're separated
(Will we ever meet each other)
I cannot bare to say it
(Ever again)

Is this just the abrupt
Is this just the abrupt
End?
