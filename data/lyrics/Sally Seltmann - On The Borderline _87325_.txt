Remember when you told me in the morning, you said I was tough
Tougher than the average woman, but I guess that is not tough enough
'Cause when you left me on the weekend, I was crumbling
At the roots and the stem, like a flower dying in the garden

Now you're gone, I have to strengthen up my little heart
Find my own way, light my torch and sparkle my own spark
When I wake up in the morning I feel very numb
But I'm gonna get through, I'm gonna tell myself every day

Get yourself up, get yourself up
Get yourself out of bed
This is a new day, this is a new day
This is a new day today
Snapping your fingers, tapping your toes
You are humming a tune, you know, you know
This is a new day, this is a new day
This is a new day today

On the borderline from what is right to what is wrong
There I am and there I try, I try to carry on
And when I'm standing on a mountain I feel brave and strong
Yeah, I'm gonna get through with or without you

Get yourself up, get yourself up
Get yourself out of bed
This is a new day, this is a new day
This is a new day today
Snapping your fingers, tapping you toes
You are humming a tune, you know, you know
This is a new day, this is a new day
This is a new day today

I'm gonna change, I'm gonna change
I'm gonna change the way I see myself today
But there’s gotta be an easier way
An easier way to start the day

Get yourself up, get yourself up
Get yourself out of bed
This is a new day, this is a new day
This is a new day today
Snapping your fingers, tapping your toes
You are humming a tune, you know, you know
This is a new day, this is a new day
This is a new day today
