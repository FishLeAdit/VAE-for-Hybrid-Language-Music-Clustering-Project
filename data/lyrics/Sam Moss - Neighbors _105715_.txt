Well, you've come to look at your neighbors
Yeah, a quiet bunch, who don't leave home
Sitting in your bedroom
Rocking the chair to pieces, moving on

Yeah, I see a few ghosts, when you are smiling
When you are sad, they cannot move
Breathing in a four leaf clover
Spitting out a hollow tomb

All wrapped up in a blanket
Say, are you warm tonight?
I am whispering, dreaming
Cradled by that shiny pale moonlight

Oh, fill me up, you won't exist
Get me out of this old twist
My bones hurt, I need to move
Your wind blows, my breath is through

All wrapped up in a blanket
Say, are you warm tonight? Yeah
I am whispеring, dreaming
Fighting off that devil's appetitе
