I will find a way
To get to you someday
Oh but I, babe, I'm so afraid I'll fall, yeah
Now can't you hear me call?

Shake some action's what I need
To let me bust out at full speed
And I'm sure that's all you'll need
To make it alright

It's taken me so long
To get where I belong
Oh, but Lord, please
Don't send me back that way, yeah
Or I will make you pay

Shake some action's what I need
To let me bust out at full speed
And I'm sure that's all you'll need
To make it alright
Woo!


If you don't dig what I say
Then I will go away
And I won't come this way again, no
'Cause I don't need a friend

Shake some action's what I need
To let me bust out at full speed
And I'm sure that's all you'll need
To make it alright (Woo! Yeah!)
