I couldn't sleep anyway
The hole you left is full of rain
Morning birds screamed all night
If there was just a little light left
Something to grow into panic
Homeless
Coming home
I could not stop moving
Now i can't move
I miss you
I bet i take this lying down
You know it'd be a justified sin
You know it'd be a justified sin
You know it'd be clean
You know it'd be purifying
You know it'd be purifying
You know it'd be clean
Morning birds screamed all night
If there was just a little fright left
Something to grow into panic
Homeless
Coming home
I could not stop moving
Now i can't move
I miss you
