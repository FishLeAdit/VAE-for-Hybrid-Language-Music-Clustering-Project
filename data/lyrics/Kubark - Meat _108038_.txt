I can use a paper
I  can use a pencil
I  can use a pen
Spray paint
A stencil
I  can use glue
Scrapwood 
And cork
I  can use a tin
And a knife
And fork
I can use random things I find
To  show you all the thoughts I have on my mind
Wooh!
I can use concrete
I can use machines
I can use paper mache
Paint
And a squeegee
I can use scissors
I can use my fingers
I can use canvas
Ink
And a printer
I can use things people left behind
To show you all the thoughts I have on my mind
Wooh!
I can use pixels
I can use a jigsaw
I can use plywood
Screws
And Gipsel
I can use a scalpel
I can use examples
I can use clamps
Scotch tape
And powertools
I can use things of any kind
To show you all the thoughts I have on my mind
I could use a hand
I could use a hand
I could use a hand
