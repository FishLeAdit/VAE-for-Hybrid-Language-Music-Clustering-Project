(Intro)
I love the waves
(Verse)
How about energy?
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Give her another time
No relation, no relation
Search mountains when I sleep
In the air but, in the air but
(Chorus)
Soon you’ve gotta do something sad, ad
You, you gotta do something
(Verse)
Go to better times
Make her happy, make her happy
Moonstruck energy
Don’t rehearse it, don’t rehearse it
Next drop that I see
Make the offer, make the offer
(Chorus)
Soon you’ve gotta do something sad, ad
You, you gotta do something
(Verse)
How about energy?
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Give her another time
No relation, no relation
Search mountains when I sleep
In the air but, in the air but
(Chorus)
Soon you’ve gotta do something sad, ad
You, you gotta do something sad, ad
You, you gotta do something sad
Sad
