Cvees (ft. Ike P) - “Spread Love to Ya”


I know somebody who declares he's got it made
He won't admit it, but it's just a masquerade

Ayyo, butter
I don’t know what to say or think, but somehow
These words’ll come out as I burn this haze and drink
I’ll remember when I first met you.  Summer of ninety-
-one.  Who would ever think that the god would sweat you?
If you ask for my time, I would never neglect you
Or disrespect you, risk my own life to protect you
My, you’re more than a precious jewel, diamond in the rough
Dimes you’ll love to puff and you’re crazy cool
Mocha complexion and texture of your hair is smooth
Mesmerized by your eyes while I stare at you
Plus, the softness of your lips—shit—there are no words to
Describe it.  Loving you is my primary assignment
Just give me your list of promises to keep, and, on the dotted line
I’ma sign it.  Your voice is harmony like the wine is
We could make beautiful music together—then it’s Ashford
And Simpson.  Solid as a rock, I’ll never lose interest
Hugs and kisses

Yeah, butter, I’ll spread love to ya
Give my mind, body, and soul through a hug to ya
Find a quiet spot to chill and burn the bud with ya
Hit the strip with two burners and drugs with ya
(You’re gully, ma) Yeah, momma, I’ll spread love to ya
Give my mind, body, and soul through a hug to ya
Find a quiet spot to chill and burn the bud with ya
Hit the strip with two burners and drugs with ya

Baby, I know
You’re dealing with your personal issues.  I have some of
My own.  We’ve both been searching for our comfort zone
But while we’re doing that, I can’t ignore the fact that I’m feeling
You heavy, and you’re a shortcut to Heaven, most definitely
I know that money’s not an object, but if I had it
To splurge—that’s my word—you’d be out of Douglass Projects
I know that you deserve the best, fine wine and
Cuisine, top-of-the-line designer things
A fee with the navigational screen, pounds of purple
And green, full wear to switch up daily for weeks
You told me you love diamonds—fine.  Open your mind
‘Cause, if I could, I’d throw you a whole coalmine
Through my gray skies, you’re my rays of sunshine
And I don’t have to worry ‘bout you crying—not one time
‘Cause, not only are you classy and sassy, but the streets
Is in your bloodstream and get your grizzly on for the green
You heard me?

Yeah, butter, I’ll spread love to ya
Give my mind, body, and soul through a hug to ya
Find a quiet spot to chill and burn the bud with ya
Hit the strip with two burners and drugs with ya
(You’re gully, ma)

What the
World needs now (I'm telling you)
(Love is what we need) is love, more
Love is what we need.  What the
World needs now is (We need more love)
Love (Whoo!).  More
Love is what we need

Yeah, butter, I’ll spread love to ya
Give my mind, body, and soul through a hug to ya
Find a quiet spot to chill and burn the bud with ya
Hit the strip with two burners and drugs with ya
(You’re gully, ma) Yeah, momma, I’ll spread love to ya
Give my mind, body, and soul through a hug to ya
Find a quiet spot to chill and burn the bud with ya
Hit the strip with two burners and drugs with ya

Spread love (Hey)
We’ve got to spread love (Instead of spreading lies)
Spread love (Oooh)
Dah, dah-dah (The truth needs no disguise, oh)
(Said love)
(Could open any door, but I)
(Wish we had much more)
More love is what we need—need...
Spread love
Dah, dah-dah
Spread love
Dah, dah-dah.  (I've often)
(Said love)
(Could open any door, but I wish we)
(Had much more)
More love is what we need
