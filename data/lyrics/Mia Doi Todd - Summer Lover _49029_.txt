Come on, summer, give me a smile
That long, cold winter lasted quite a while
Come on, summer, sweet lemonade
A skinny dip, a picnic by the lake
The green grass and the pine trees, they do me good
And the bright sun on my skin feeling brand new
Brand new in love with you
In love with you
Come on, summer, work your charm
A golden tan and this lovely man on my arm
Come on, summer, laughing all day
And love all night in the soft bed where we lay
Let’s go down to the beach
See the sunset sky
Our dancing mandala feet
Wash out in the tide, the tide
The tide is coming and going
The tide is coming and going
Summer lover
You make me smile
You make me smile
Come on, summer, fill me up to my ears
With love and light to last me all through the year
Summer lover
Summer, you do me good
You do me good
