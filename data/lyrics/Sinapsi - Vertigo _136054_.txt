Love cannot be trusted
You will not find me here
No, love cannot be trusted
I am a million pieces
Your fingers are all crumbled
Your face has turned to stone
Tears of agony
Is all you left for me, I know
Define my reason...
Let me grow
Let me grow
Let me know
My soul is just a fleshwound
Let me grow
Take my heart out
Rip my soul off
Take my heart out
Only you know
Sorrowfed
