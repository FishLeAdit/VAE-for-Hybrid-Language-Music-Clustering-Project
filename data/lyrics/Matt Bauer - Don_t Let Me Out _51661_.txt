I killed you and thought that that was that
But right away your ghost comes back
And I can't get my hands around it
No I can't get my hands around you
Uh huh
My leg is caught up in a trap
I licked the blood and I stopped to nap
And I dream
Yeah I dream about you
Well I have seen you
But I tend to doubt you
Uh huh
Girls jumpin' off the new river bridge
The water rushes up to them
And their hair
Floats up to heaven
And it's so pretty
Well I can't stand it
It's so pretty
Well I can't take it
Uh huh
Oh there you are at the magic theater
Black dress, hands up, in the air
Well I've heard
Yeah I've heard about this
Time to time, thought I'd seen it
Uh huh
Oh the show is over, everybody's gone
The air was cool, and the pines were long
And draped down, from the blackness
Mmm mmm mm mmm
Oh you saw my coffin and got right in
Took a hammer in your hand
And you knocked those nails right out of it
Yeah you knocked those nails right out of it
But I'm sayin' no, don't let me out
No, don't let me out
