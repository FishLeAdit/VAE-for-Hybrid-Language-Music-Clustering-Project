Oh honey
I've been finding the time
For I must be
Over on the angels way
Oh honey
I've been finding the time
For I must be
Over on the angels way

Winter fun passing out of the gun
Taking time moments on the stereo
Making a loud sound, we came in the dark
Watch out for the laughter rain, or a wild sudden storm

Winter fun passing out of the gun
Taking time moments on the stereo
Making a loud sound, we came in the dark
