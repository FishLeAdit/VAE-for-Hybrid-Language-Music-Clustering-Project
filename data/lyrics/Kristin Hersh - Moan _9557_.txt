In the deep cold
You can't be brave
In the deep cold
You can't be safe
When the wind blows
You won't be strong
When the wind blows
You won't be strong
Blows with a spine-chilling
Moan
Let's drink to each other
And drink each other half to death
I'm jumping out of my skin
I'm jumping out of my skin again
