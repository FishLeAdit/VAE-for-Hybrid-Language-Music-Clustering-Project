Never gonna let no one break me down
Hanged tough, gave it my best
When you tried to run me into the ground
It's rough, no time to rest
No tears now that I'm so much stronger
No fears cause I got what it takes
Give me your best shot
That's what I'm ready for
Whatever you have to dish out
Give me your best shot
Don't have to aim so far
This time I'm here to stay
Don't think I'll run away
Nothing's gonna stop what I feel inside
Don't say you know what's right
Searching for the pleasure to hurt my pride
I say this is my life
My heart knows a way to survival
Don't start looking for betrayal
Give me your best shot...
SPOKEN:
How's it gonna be
We're supposed to be free
Put a pen in your hand
And you think you're the man
Don't try to tell me how to run my life
I know it's not all sugar and spice
But love has made me strong
Gave me the strength to carry on
I am no judge
But if you're never wrong
You cast the first stone
1 2 3
Give me your best shot
Don't think I'll run away
Give me your best shot
Give me your best shot...
I'll never give up, never give up
I'll be there
I'm the winner, you're the loser
I'm never gonna stay
Don't think I'll run away
