(You said you're praying for me
You said you're praying for me
You said you're praying for me
You said you're praying for me)
You said you're praying for me
You said you're waiting for me too
I said quit praying for me
'Cause I'll be fine on my own, too
I got a new flow too
But baby I told you
This the music to ride to
Music to die to
Baby, this this THE VIBE
We in the candle light
So you don't gotta cry
'Cause you know I'll make it right
I always make it right
The pain is glorified
Ain't got no ride of die
And I ain't feelin' right
I ain't feelin' right (I ain't feelin' right)
Mixin' Dirty Sprite (Mixin' Dirty Sprite)
Dreamin' every night (Dreamin' every night)
Drowning in the light (Drowning in the light)
You said you're praying for me
You said you'rе waiting for me too
I said quit praying for me
'Cause I'll bе fine on my own, too
I got a new flow too
But baby I told you
This the music to ride to
Music to die to
Baby, this this THE VIBE
We in the candle light
So you don't gotta cry
'Cause you know I'll make it right
I always make it right
The pain is glorified
Ain't got no ride of die
And I ain't feelin' right
("Why don't you go home ?"
"Because I hate ghosts. And my home is full of them.")
You said you're praying for me
You said you're waiting for me too
I said quit praying for me
'Cause I'll be fine on my own, too
I got a new flow too
But baby I told you
This the music to ride to
Music to die to
Baby, this this THE VIBE
We in the candle light
So you don't gotta cry
'Cause you know I'll make it right
I always make it right
The pain is glorified
Ain't got no ride of die
And I ain't feelin' right
