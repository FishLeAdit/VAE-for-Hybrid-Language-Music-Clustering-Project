I could swear by the blue
In the sea and the sky
It's red and it's black
I can see in your eye
One colour is danger
The other is hate
You said I was good
But could never be great
In the morning the razor cuts my skin
You cut me down just for asking the truth
Please kill me
Don't refuse

If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
Please tell me
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
Please tell me

Wanna scream
Wanna shout
For the dreams
But many doubts
And your brain is feeling suffocated
Don't be silly
Let it out
Or I'm giving up
If you got bluffs
Imma ring it up
I don't want much
If I did enough
Then I'm not fussed
If I give it up
From the jump
Lies are a lose-lose when
I can, I can land on the proof
But Imma need a few good men
That can that can handle the truth
So please don't wait
Please don't lie to my face
Waste my time and my space
Stakes are high, don't hesitate

If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
Please tell me
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
Please tell me

Been thinkin' lately
Maybe you ain't so clean
When you say "Ali, come hold me"
Wonder why you're lonely
Maybe there's somethin' you're bluffin'
Could I trust that you woulda told me
's not like I have proof
But I have a few damn clues
Like them texts
From your ex
That read devil-like man you
I plan to find out soon
Maybe I'm paranoid
Maybe I do feel guilty
I've done a few things filthy
And it kills me that I lie
What can I, can I say, I'm a guy

If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
Please tell me
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
If there's something I should know
Please tell me
