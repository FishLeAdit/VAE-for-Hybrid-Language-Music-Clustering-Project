Hook : Hi-Rez]
Man i pray so long
That i get up out the zone
And i make it to the top all on my own
But why's it feels so wrong
Man i been feeling all alone
And everything around me been moving slow
I be waking with sweats
And having visions of death
I used to never have worries
But now i'm having regrets
I ain't never ever sleeping
I'm never getting no rest
I work myself half to death
And y'all remain not impressed
What the heck, hey


Poppin' xanax for the stress
I got a lot on my chest
Sometimes i think about death
And realize i'm really blessed
So i guess i can't complain
Anxiety on my brain
Until you walk in my shoes
Don't tell me you feel my pain
Don't tell me you could relate
'Cause trust me, nobody can
The people who used to hate
Is now claiming they was my man
Success is a part of the plan
And you just ain't in the picture
Spill my thoughts while sipping liquor
Call my exes like i miss 'em
Reminiscing of the past
When all was good with no problems
Before the bills even mattered
Now talking Hilary Bodham
All the bad times and memories
Praying that i'll forget 'em
If the haters hate then let 'em
Don't worry never regret
The things you, done in your lifetime
Critics must be quite blind
And to be honest with you i just ain't been in my right mind
Money be tight i'm, struggling for Deniro
But i don't care 'cause i know one day they'll treat me like a pharaoh
Motherfucker

Man i pray so long
That i get up out the zone
And i make it to the top all on my own
But why's it feels so wrong
Man i been feeling all alone
And everything around me been moving slow
I be waking with sweats
And having visions of death
I used to never have worries
But now i'm having regrets
I ain't never ever sleeping
I'm never getting no rest
I work myself half to death
And y'all remain not impressed
What the heck, hey

Parents be missing me
Repetition going through life changes
Wishing for better days
They telling me to be patient
Can't turn to maryjane
All my problems : gotta face 'em
Wish i could just erase 'em
Feel like my time ain't wasted
I'm, hella close to greatness
I felt like i could taste it
Questioning my confidence
I don't think i'mma make it
Depression taking over
'Not sure how much i could take of it
18 feeling like i'm 50 it's so crazy
Gotta keep my head up
Pops told me never let up
I been on my ass bumming around
It's time to get up
Success ain't gonna hit me
I gotta go out and find it
They say that life could be grinding
But i'll never stop the grinding, 'til i die
Like the Mayans predicted that shit would happen
And they crying at my funerals
All the people who laughed
At the dream finally realized
That they staring at a real guy
Success is earned slowly
And i'll never have to steal mine

Man i pray so long
That i get up out the zone
And i make it to the top all on my own
But why's it feels so wrong
Man i been feeling all alone
And everything around me been moving slow
I be waking with sweats
And having visions of death
I used to never have worries
But now i'm having regrets
I ain't never ever sleeping
I'm never getting no rest
I work myself half to death
And y'all remain not impressed
