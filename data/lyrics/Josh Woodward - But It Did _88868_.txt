The skies they opened up, and now the frogs are pouring out
Splattering and scattered on the ground
Falling on the sidewalk, in the middle of the street
This couldn't ever happen but it did
We are standing silent in a stupor at the sight
Gazing on with glazy eyes apart
Oh, you couldn't ever see, it couldn't ever be
This couldn't ever happen but it did
The canvas on the parasols are ripping at the frame
The streetlights on the avenue are red
Oh, you couldn't ever see, it couldn't ever be
This couldn't ever happen but it did
This couldn't ever happen but it did
Streets are full of carnage and the avenues are red
Everybody waiting for the kid
This couldn't ever happen but it did
History is scratching on the windows of the past
Fighting on to see the light of day
We could've let it out, we could've let it out
We could have, but we never really did
