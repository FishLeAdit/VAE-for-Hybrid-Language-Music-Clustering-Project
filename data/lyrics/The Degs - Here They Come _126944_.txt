Clocks stop ticking every day
Sounds stop, ringing hopelessly
Damned if you do, damned if you don't
You might believe in something else
Extensions of the ancient bombs
Expressions in the age of what it seems

Here come the dogs!
Here come the dogs!
Here come the dogs!
Here come the dogs!

Damned if you do, damned if you don't
You might believe in all of this
First of the last nocturnal songs
Anyone's anything from nothing

Here come the dogs!
Here come the dogs!
Here come the dogs!
Here come the dogs!
