We were two little people wrapped up in this big old world
Drifting round in space out of place just a boy and girl
Then you took my hand and made me a part of you
And I looked in your heart
And saw all my dreams come true

You did the impossible
You rescued my love
You did the impossible
See, I had almost given up

And now I love ya like summer time, love ya like cherry wine
Love ya like free money, like a preacher loves Sunday
Love ya like freeze pop, love ya like a milk shake
Love ya like a high school girl on a first date
Love ya like shootin' stars, love ya like a muscle car
Love ya like we're destined
Love ya like my lover and my best friend
Yeah, you did the impossible

Tonight I'm gonna need all your attention
Close the door
I wanna do things I probably shouldn't mention
Like a bird I'm gon' hum
Those three words, I love you, I love you, I love you
Freeze the time, let the world go by
If you're mine say, you love me, you love me, you love me
Boy take my hand and make me a part of you
And the love that you gave to me has pulled me through

You did the impossible
You rescued my love
You did the impossible
See, I had almost given up

And now I love ya like sunsets, bubble baths on the jet
Love ya like Kool-aid, Louis Millionaire shades
Love ya like sugar daddys, love ya like a pimp caddy
Love ya like a holiday Duncan Hines yellow cake
Love ya like it's 5 am and I'm off work
(Okay so it's 5 am...)
Love ya like Louboutin heels and a mini skirt
Love ya like an Asscher cut pink and white engagement ring
Love ya like layin' in a bed bumpin Jodeci

And I'm forever your lady
Laying in the bed bumpin' Jodeci
And I'm forever your lady
Laying in the bed bumpin' Jodeci
And I'm forever your lady
(I love you like the sunsets in the evening)
Laying in the bed bumpin' Jodeci
(Like the shooting stars)
And I'm forever your lady
(Yeah, I love you)
Laying in the bed bumpin' Jodeci
(Oh, you did the impossible)

I'd almost given up
The impossible
