I've seen you cry
A thousand times
You never leave your bedroom anymore
Your face is red
I understand
You never try to ease your mind
Seasons die and leave behind
Dead leaves scattered on the lawn
Settled dust on things you love
They won't last very long
I’ll say goodbye
Just for tonight
Can’t be around this anymore
Shattered eyes
In paradise
Can't see the meaning of the moment
Seasons die and leave behind
Dead leaves scattered on the lawn
Settled dust on things you love
They won't last very long
I see you cry
And tears run dry
No longer holding onto fleeting hearts
Uncertain thoughts
You come across
It doesn't change the cards that fall
Seasons die and leave behind
Dead leaves scattered on the lawn
Settled dust on things you love
They won’t last very long
