I was a soldier boy in the twilight of my youth
When I still could feel love and a trust in above for the truth
I fought with bravery, then I left my gun behind
But the misery I've seen never wiped itself clean from my mind
Now I never, ever close my eyes completely
When I'm sleeping...
I barely recognize the people that I knew
The faces the same and I still couldn't name but a few
If god isn't dead, then I'll kill him myself
Cuz I've seen the worst, I'm not scared to just burst into hell
Now I never, ever close my eyes completely
When I'm sleeping, I'm not dreaming
