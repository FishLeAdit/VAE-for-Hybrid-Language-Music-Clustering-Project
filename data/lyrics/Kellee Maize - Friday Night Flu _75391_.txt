U know u wanna dance
N u know u wanna rock
Come on take a chance
Forget about the clock
Rock with Me
Dance with Me
You know you wanna dance
You know you wanna rock
Come on and take a chance (rock with me)
Forget about the clock (Dance with me)
The clock struck 12
Your godmommas gone
Cinderellas still here
On the floor alone
Go head and try your luck
Nobody gives a f*ck
Say bye to the drama
N start shakin the trunk
Scared to sing cause you feel a lump
In your throat now stop bein a punk
U know how to wipe out that junk
Trashman in your mind said dump
Up and down do u feel that jump
Heart is raising u love that thump
On your back there ain't no hump
Cause you know how to feel that funk
I feel the vibes
I'm shakin inside
My brain open wide
I'm swayin side to side
Now u can two step or diddy bop
Breakdancing can Pop and lock
Going all night I'm talking non stop
Release that fright take it to the top
No one on the corner got swager like you
Not gonna warn her just do what you do
Now watch those hands ull be black and blue
I call my mans after u you know who
This ain't a game of Seek and find
Just say my name clear out your mind
Shake out the outta date while you bump and grind
Start right here Now is your time
