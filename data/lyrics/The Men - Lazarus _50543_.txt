Behold the dreadful wailing of the sodomites who wallow in morbific blood issuing forth from the putrid bladder of Satan
You're guts will be spun on the loom of judgement, to drip like pus into the mouths of the unconverted
You will become like shit on the shoe of a Lucifer, the gristle in a pool of Demonic vomit
You will become the genital warts that adorn the arse of Hades
All this and more shall you become in the final days of Man
The Dragon and beast cast into hell
Death into the valley of Jehoshaphat
The earth will shake at the end of days
Men will flee into holes and caves
Al hail the swarm of shedim that commeth like flies from the bottomless pit
Hark the horns of Armageddon for they herald the messianic oracle of slaughter and wrath
Apocalypse, an oracle of darkness, apocalypse, of brimstone and fire
Apocalypse, the whore of Babylon, Apocalypse, demonic holocaust
Apocalypse, the shattered universe, Apocalypse, a fellowship of death
Apocalypse, the number of the beast, Apocalypse, the devouring locust
Apocalypse, a holy revelation, Apocalypse, the seventh seal of god
Apocalypse, seducer of the earth
Apocalypse, a pale horse of death, Apocalypse, satanic war machine
Apocalypse, the dragon of chaos, Apocalypse, the dead will be reborn
