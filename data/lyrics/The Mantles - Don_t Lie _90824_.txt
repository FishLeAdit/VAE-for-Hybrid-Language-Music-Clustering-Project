And the very thought of ruin
Distant this pain tonight
Nights like this will lift even
The heaviest of hearts
Go out and shed your death
Just let it fall right down
Endless fascination
How much will you hold
And no matter how you do it
It’s gonna turn out right
Of the stars above you
Which one heals your eye
Without memory to hang
You can lose yourself
As long as truth is with you
Your love will be good
Good love will kill it
Please don’t lie
