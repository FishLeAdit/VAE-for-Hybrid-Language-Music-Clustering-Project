All voices move out
From the order that we left them
Turn up and turn around
Hear them call your name

If you call out, call out, call out, call out
I will follow
If you call out, call out, call out, call out
I will follow you

Hah-ah, ah-ha, ha-ah, ha
Hah-ah, ah-ha, ha-ah, ha
Hah-ah, ah-ha, ha-ah, ha
Hah-ah, ah-ha, ha-ah

Meeting at the bus-stop
The early morning look-out crowd
Dizzy from the tire view
Hear them call your name

Look the others follow: one, two
One, two; one, two
Birds are singing up and down around
And all around us

Hah-ah, ah-ha, ha-ah, ha
Hah-ah, ah-ha, ha-ah, ha
Hah-ah, ah-ha, ha-ah, ha
Hah-ah, ah-ha, ha-ah

If you call out, call out, call out, call out
I will follow
If you call out, call out, call out, call out
I will follow you

If you call out, call out, call out, call out
I will follow
If you call out, call out, call out, call out
I will follow you
Ooh-ooh
