Yo, yo, yo
At the start people doubted I would make it this far
But I'm proving them wrong
Everybody critized and hated on me but I just stay strong
And no matter what I heard them tell me
It didn't change my mind
I'm still pushing hard working hard daily
I'm in a race with time

I put my life on the record
Always giving it effort
At night I'm always restless, this music's a life sentence
Perfecting my craft in seconds
The essences of the herbs
Used to make the world turn
People earn was not deserved
By the weak and not dead
Got people losing they heads
This evils making me bad
I hope I make my father proud
Devote my life to writing raps
I hope I'm on the right path
Spending years of my life that I could never take back
I lost friends in the process
They disappeared like magic
Put all my eggs in one basket
And all they said I was average
Still I fucking went after something that they couldn't see
I'm on my way to being what they said I wouldn't be
So nod your head to the beat
If you ever had a dream
And everybody else around you just never seemed to believe
That sound exactly like me
I was right in your position
So listen close what I'm saying
Don't never give up your visions on the real

At the start people doubted I would make it this far
But I'm proving them wrong
Everybody critized and they hated on me but I just stayed strong
And no matter what I heard them tell me
It didn't change my mind
I'm still pushing hard working hard daily
I'm in a race with time

All these thoughts in my head
Are brought to the pen
They ain't clicking while I'm thinking
Mind lost in the way
I sit alone house empty
Getting under my skin
I just don't know why y'all envy my life cause it ain't shit
But I'm predictable days
I hope this all just a phase
The rays of the sun ain't shining when I ain't seeing your face
The good life don't even taste good
Such a waste
Whats my face someone tell me the right path to take
Cause I'm a lost soul walking
So please proceed with caution
In this world that I'm lost in, I'm alone more than often
My soul is in the darkness but I'm searching for the light
Always doing wrong but I'm out here searching for the right
And I even lost sight of my visions for a second
But that's just another lesson that I reckon will help me reach my success
But nah I'm still building my plot
Regardless of what I go through I'm still gonna reach the top
Try and stop me

At the start people doubted I would make it this far
But I'm proving them wrong
Everybody critized and hated on me but I just stay strong
And no matter what I heard them tell me
It didn't change my mind
I'm still pushing hard working hard daily
I'm in a race with time
