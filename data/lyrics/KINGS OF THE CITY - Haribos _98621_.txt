Yo
I chuckle to myself
'Cause life is delightful
I love it when a girl acts spiteful
It means she cares
Her name was Lola
I offered her a whisky cola
She said you sound like a sleazy prick
I said nah, I’m straight queasy yeah
So I don't really care
The hillside, that sunrise
Darlin' I’ll see you there
I walked off
She grabbed for my right shoulder
Told me it won't be the same when the nights over
Said I'm a King Of The City so the night's know us
Everything will be picture perfect with the right focus
She was hopeless, against my cool demeanor
And an animal attraction meant I wouldn't leave her
But possibly mislead her, no compassion as of late
My clothes were a rip-off and I came fashionably late
After she asked about my past seven days
Told her the week  in this hellish ways
Rock and roll is in the soul like the piff I blaze
I know I gotta go but you know it's the only
I chuckle to myself 'cause life is exciting
She was a lady of the road I couldn't help likin’

Ain’t no lovin'
I’d rather rock the boat
When I leave the smoke
'Cause ain't no lovin'
I’d rather rock the boat
When I leave the smoke
Leave it all behind me
Leave it all behind
Leave it all behind me

See when you first start
You keep the work rate
'Cause when you go far
You'll see the worth mate
They say the roads hard
But the girls aren't (Ha)
Still I put her mind at ease
For her sake
I've learnt mate
This game was made for the type of female
Who doesn't feel ashamed that her name is a minor detail, uh
Writing me well, uh
In private emails
And I hope that we both make a story we'd like to retail
So you understand what I need from you
That one thing is making both of our dreams come true
So if I like what I see, come true
'Cause I'll be on stage on the mic
Checkin' the beat, one two
She's warmed up
But assuming the cold shoulder
Her showtime starts as soon as the shows over
'Cause when I bring her back
I control her like she's one of my puppets
With no strings attached, ha
To give it up she don't give a damn
She's plannin' to split her legs in the splitter van
I chuckle to myself 'cause life is exciting
She was a lady of the road I couldn't help likin'

Ain't no lovin'
I'd rather rock the boat
When I leave the smoke
'Cause ain't no lovin'
I'd rather rock the boat
When I leave the smoke
Leave it all behind me
Leave it all behind
Leave it all behind me

Goodbye
See you later
Hm
(?), yeah
