Well you walk into my room
Lookin' all innocent and lost
With your sleazy dress barely coverin' up
All the parts that you know that I want
You talk about the past
And ask me how I'm gettin' on
Yeah you're rememberin' all the good times
That we had before you turned up gone
And by the way I smile and stare
You think that I'm maybe goin' for it
But do you take me for a fool?
I wouldn't touch you with a stick
I know what you came here for
But I ain't no kid anymore

You think I don't know what your game is
You think that I'm blind
You think I'm fool enough
To ever want to play with...
You think I've lost my mind?

Well I do
And I'm not
And I don't and it won't matter if you stand here
'Til the cows come home
So don't you waste your precious time

And when that don't work
You start in pullin' rabbits out your hat
And you're pretty good
But we're not amused
Now would you kindly put them back
You drop some names that I once mentioned
Thinking maybe I'll respond
But I've passed beyond all of that nonsense
What with the Arabs droppin' bombs
Did you really think that you could trick me
Just by memorizing names?
Oh you're a spicey little number
But your mind's between your legs

You think I don't know what your game is
You think that I'm blind
You think I'm fool enough
To ever want to play with...
You think I've lost my mind?

Well I do
And I'm not
And I don't and it won't matter if you stand here
'Til these cattle go home
So don't you waste my precious time
I'm not buyin'
I ain't interested
Go away
