Landslide, wide-eyed, running to the ends of what
Name you, chain you, bottle you up and train you
To be solid upright, but we can't run forever this
Face is facing forward but you're halted to the hearing
Landslide, wild-child, turn your body back, say
'I'm gonna do this way i want and never gonna
Look behind' and when you
Show this, own this, they'll run for cover
You're comin' like a landslide…
This a crucible, endless ritual
Circled by fire, not asking to be saved and
In your crucible all is touchable
Burn away, only you remaining…
Landslide, wide eyed, own your body back to what it
Gave you, namеs do only what they're meaning so bе
Solid upright, you came in like a fury and your
Purpose is a truth-test, ruthless — speak child!
Heart-side, wild-wise, seeing only half-full
Bashful in the beauty yet your arrows meet their
Mark every moment barely woken woven deep
Into their cover, you're comin' like a landslide…
We call from the sun-bound seer
We throw in the light from here…
This a crucible, endless ritual
Circled by fire not asking to be saved and
In your crucible all is touchable
Burn away, only you remaining…
