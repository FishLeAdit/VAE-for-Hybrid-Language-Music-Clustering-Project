Leave your self behind
With your ego and your pride
I can feel it in your heart
There is a hole and divide
Is there any meaning that
Death does not destroy?
Watch the sun rise from the dark sky
Write a ballad for the boy


Leave your self behind
With your ego and your pride
I can feel it in your heart
There is a hole and divide
Is there any meaning that
Death does not destroy?
Watch the sun rise from the dark sky
Write a ballad for the boy

March towards a bitter end
Ponder your last breath
Move beyond your conscious self
Amidst the face of death
Beyond perception, actuality
Transcend rationality
Take a leap of faith or else
You will perish and cease

Leave your self behind
With your ego and your pride
I can feel it in your heart
There is a hole and divide
Is there any meaning that
Death does not destroy?
Watch the sun rise from the dark sky
Write a ballad for the boy
