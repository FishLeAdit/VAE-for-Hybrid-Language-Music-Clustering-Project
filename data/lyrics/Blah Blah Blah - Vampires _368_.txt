It's all business
It's all business
It's all business
Fuck her right in the pussy
It's all business

Black on Black, ridin' on Porsches
Black on Black, she 
Black on Black, livin' in mansions
Black on Black, money enhancin'
Black on Black, ridin' on Porsches
Black on Black, she 
Black on Black, livin' in mansions
Black on Black, money enhancin'

Dear god please take all the pain away
Variation gone so I'm livin' right every day
Come and clean mean, well bitch, fuck a limousine
Young nigga run this shit, bitch you know I'm 'bout to cream
Martin Luther King had a dream just for me to stunt
Shittin' on my non-believers, get the money counted up
Hundred dollar million, gotta get it in the bank account
Stack it to the ceiling, baby tell me how you feelin' now
Playa ass philosophy, not stoppin' me, I'm gettin' clout
Me and her astrology got perfect, now she goin' down
Get it how you live, pussy nigga makin' big amounts
Bitch poppin' pussy, put some bands, she gon' make it bounce
Ridin' in your town, hit the club, shuttin' shit down
Niggas know we run this shit, no snitchin' 
Where the money? Hella pounds, 
Dreams of a young boss, 

Black on Black, ridin' on Porsches
Black on Black, she 
Black on Black, livin' in mansions
Black on Black, money enhancin'
Black on Black, ridin' on Porsches
Black on Black, she 
Black on Black, livin' in mansions
Black on Black, money enhancin'
