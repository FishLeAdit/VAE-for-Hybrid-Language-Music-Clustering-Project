Salt on my tongue
Air in my lungs
Sound in my ear
Nothing to fear
Heaven is here
Heaven is here

There's only this
That I can see
All of the space
Surrounding me
Surrounding me
Surrounding me
What can this be?

Heaven is only human
Heaven is only human
Heaven is only human

There is a date
There on the wall
Tearing the pages
Watching them fall
Watching them fall
Watching them fall
So this is all?

Heaven is only human
Heaven is only human
Heavеn is only human

I can’t believe thе void
I can't believe the voice, no!

Heaven is only human
Heaven is only human
