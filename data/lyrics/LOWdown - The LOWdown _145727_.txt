Yeah, ey
London the home of the greats
The homeless can live by the Buckingham gates
London the birth of the pow
Home of the Gunners, shooters and Lewis, the birth of the wow
Birth of the now, birth of the 
You can get parred, you can get loud
You're safer than houses when you're in a moshpit
And you don't know none of the crowd
London, you're just one of the crowd
Wherever you go in the world, if you know you're from London
You know that you're saying it loud
And if you ain't from here and you're disrespecting
You know wagwan, you're looking around
Oi, oi, telling you now
Man'll get aggy for running your mouth
