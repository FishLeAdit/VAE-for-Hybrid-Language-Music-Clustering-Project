Another day without a dollar, man, sometimes I wanna holler
I ain't got a pot to piss in, no window to throw it out of
I done tried to play the lotto, but my numbers never hit
Until the one day I decided I ain't gonna play that bitch wish
I could go out to the club, I can't really do that
'Cause you can't purchase liquor with a pocket full of food stamps
All that's on my mind is having better things
Yes I dream of having credit and whatever cheddar brings
Yeah it seems all this lack of loot has really got me starvin'
So I'm eatin' ramen noodles, can't afford the Olive Garden
My problem, my money's never right, and yeah it burns
I hate to spend a bunch of time lookin' for bottles to return
See, there's no chillin', pro livin' this should be beneath me
Gas so much, I'm 'bout to get myself a ten speed
Can't see me ever gettin' out of debt
I had to write a bad check just to pay the rent

Two dollars in the tank, you know I'm broke pimpin'
Smokin' butts out the tray, I'm broke pimpin'
Sole fell off my shoe, so I'm limpin'
Just to let you know the way that I live
Two dollars in the tank, you know I'm broke pimpin'
Smokin' butts out the tray, I'm broke pimpin'
Sole fell off my shoe, so I'm limpin'
Just to let you know the way that I live

Seems I can't really stand on my own two feet
You can call me Wall Street, stocks crash in defeat
Picture me feeding my kids off of WIC and dollar menus
In this condition, I don't think I can continue
In too deep, and it's got me losing sleep
Life cycle rat race, scrambling to get the cheese
I can see nothing's free, so you know I'm on a mission
Right now, I'm so broke, I can't afford to pay attention

Two dollars in the tank, you know I'm broke pimpin'
Smokin' butts out the tray, I'm broke pimpin'
Sole fell off my shoe, so I'm limpin'
Just to let you know the way that I live
Two dollars in the tank, you know I'm broke pimpin'
Smokin' butts out the tray, I'm broke pimpin'
Sole fell off my shoe, so I'm limpin'
Just to let you know the way that I live

One foot in the gutter, another step away from welfare
Trying to play the cards that this life done went and dealt, yeah
I got a letter, said I'm going to collections
Went and paid the cable bill, forgot to pay the electric
I'm guessing another month before the Comcast people see me
But they done cut my power off, so I can't see the TV
Greasy, look at my stains, they can't be 
See my work and party clothes the exact same outfit
How shit did get so bad is always on my mind
Maybe I should get my hookup back, go back on the grind
Selling dimes is a crime, and it's easy to get popped
If I get caught, I'd probably get three hots in the cop
Probably not, judge'd give me probation and hella court costs
Givin' me the penthouse suite right up in the poor house
If money is the root of all evil, I'll take my chances
Already catching hell, I'm just trying to advance it

Two dollars in the tank, you know I'm broke pimpin'
Smokin' butts out the tray, I'm broke pimpin'
Sole fell off my shoe, so I'm limpin'
Just to let you know the way that I live
Two dollars in the tank, you know I'm broke pimpin'
Smokin' butts out the tray, I'm broke pimpin'
Sole fell off my shoe, so I'm limpin'
Just to let you know the way that I'm livin'
