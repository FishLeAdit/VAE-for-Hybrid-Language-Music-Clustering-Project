Do you want to blow me up and sell my guts?
Send them overseas?
Do you want to tie me up and take this knife?
And tell me when I bleed?
Do you want to take my breath and cut it up?
Take it all from me?
Do you want to make me wait?
I'll stand alone for all eternity
And when you’re dancing by yourself
I completely fall to pieces
And when you're dancing by yourself
I completely fall to pieces
And when you're dancing by yourself
I fall to pieces
And when you’re dancing by yourself
I fall to pieces
Do you want to blow me up and sell my guts?
Send them overseas?
Do you want to take this knife and tie me up?
And tell me if I bleed?
Do you want to blow me up and take my guts?
Sell them overseas?
Do you want to tie me up and
I fall to pieces
And when you're dancing by yourself
I completely fall to pieces
And when you're dancing by yourself
I completely fall to pieces
And when you're dancing by yourself
I fall to pieces
And when you're dancing by yourself
I fall to pieces
And when you're dancing by yourself
I completely fall to pieces
And when you're dancing by yourself
I completely fall to pieces
And when you're dancing by yourself
I completely fall to pieces
And when you’re dancing by yourself
I completely fall to pieces
And when you’re dancing by yourself
