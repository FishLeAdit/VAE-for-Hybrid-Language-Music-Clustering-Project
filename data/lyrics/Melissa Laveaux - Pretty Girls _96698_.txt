Give me a mirror and I'll show you my enemy
The fear that tears through my pores ripping inside of me
A homemade bomb grows in my palm as I cut me free
My arms are witness to my ruthless loss of dignity
And all the pretty girls call me a freak
I just cut myself trying to stay neat
I'm a toothache-giving b*tch darling
I'm so sweet
I built a castle was no hassle my skin, building blocks
My cherry blood slowly floods and clots to make the knots
Up in my fortress I'm a righteous duchess super clean
The love I give myself above all else is quite serene
And all the pretty girls call me a freak
I just cut myself trying to stay neat
I'm a toothache-giving b*tch darling
I'm so sweet
And all the pretty girls
And all the pretty girls
Give me a mirror and I'll show you my enemy
The fear that tears through my pores ripping inside of me
A homemade bomb grows in my palm as I cut me free
My arms are witness to my ruthless loss of dignity
And all the pretty girls call me a freak
I just cut myself trying to stay neat
I'm a toothache-giving b*tch darling
I'm so sweet
And all the pretty girls
And all the pretty girls
And all the pretty girls
And all the pretty girls
And all the pretty girls
