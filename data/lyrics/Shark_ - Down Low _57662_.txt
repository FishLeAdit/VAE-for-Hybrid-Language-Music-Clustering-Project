Oh my God
Oh my God
You’ve got the wrong guy
I’m a cephalopod
I’ve got no spine
I got no arms
Can this be the reason why we don’t get along

Oh my God
What is wrong, girl
Can we please agree to get along
I’m all alone
I’ll be the dog
You be the leash that I’m struck upon, woah

You say we know
Like rock and roll
What’s up with that
I’m not too sure
We’ve got it all
I’ll take the fall
So adios
Just keep it on the down low

Oh my God
Oh my God
You’ve got the wrong guy
I’m taking the fall
I’ve got no spine
Got no arms
My goddamn life is falling apart

Oh my God
What is wrong, girl
Can we please agree to get along
I’m on the leash
I’ll be the dog
You bе the cat that I’ll stumble on, woah

You say we know
Likе rock and roll
What’s up with that
I’m not too sure
We’ve got it all
I’ll take the fall
So adios
Just keep it on the down low
The down low
The down low

Oh my God
Oh my God
You’ve got the wrong guy
I’m a cephalopod
I’ve got no spine
I got no arms
Can this be the reason why we don’t get along

Oh my God
What is wrong, girl
Can we please agree to get along
I’m all alone
I’ll be the dog
You be the cat that I’ll stumble on, woah

You say we know
Like rock and roll
What’s up with that
I’m not too sure
We’ve got it all
I’ll take the fall
So adios
