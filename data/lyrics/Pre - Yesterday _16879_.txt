VS2
It doesnt seem like so long ago a gentleman of God that I used to know
Doing what he could to make the kingdom grow
He touched my very soul
I still recall him standing by the old brown door, shaking hands and saying welcome back once more
The warmth in his smile you could not ignore; thats what they came there for
CHORUS
This is for yesterdays preacher who gave his life paving the way
He was doing his part by giving his heart
Thats why Im singing today
Thats why Im singing today

He was jack of all trades  he had to do it all  from shoveling snow to playing basketball
Late in the night he was the one theyd call because he always made trouble seem small
VS3
He never had a life of his own, living week to week was all hed ever known
He never reaped the harvest for the seeds hed sown but look how much weve grown
CHORUS
This is for yesterdays preacher who gave his life paving the way
He was doing his part by giving his heart
Thats why Im singing today
Thats why Im singing today
VS4
Then one winter day that preacher died;
The only time I ever saw that undertaker cry
His loving wife bent down and kissed him goodbye and everybody cried
Oh but up in heaven now an angel band plays all his favorite hymns at his command
He and Jesus now walking hand in hand -- Oh what a happy man!
CHORUS
This is for yesterdays preacher who gave his life paving the way
He was doing his part by giving his heart
Thats why Im singing today
Thats why Im singing today
