Subterraneans maintain own tongue amongst ruins
In subdued tones, I speak of the flesh which entombs our inner core
Who the blessed? Invade airwaves type Moors (Wars)
Sore from travels to unmarked threshold
Grapple truths untold lying in whispers, it figures
He who snickers doesn't hear final melody
Shattered splinters, melodic in they own unrest
Reminds me of Osiris, made liars of us all
For three hundred and sixty four days I learned to crawl
Appalled by sense of urgency to resurrect the dead
Shed my last skin searching for angel with broken wing
Will she sing that E minor hymn
For those of us who sin, for those of us who sin?
Will she sing that E minor hymn
For those of us who sin, for those of us who sin?
Within dirty sanctum, became brethren's anthem
Jesus Christ a black man, walks the earth still
Forgot to speak the real, struggle's fate's not sealed
I appeal to nil, never one, not one, none

Shunned by rays of Amun-Ra
Darkness exposes every soul's flaw, I forever remain raw
Unpolished, drunk off knowledge and knowing I'm dumb
Now remain unsung while inner eye stays numb
We all shall succumb to eternal sleep
For now, I'll just yawn and speak on ill gutter beats
Watch falling leaves, walk on knees
Down graveled path, vocalize own epitaph
Evoke on path towards inner nonlinear
Lay head amongst sinner, solitude, fall, winter
Appalled at visual surroundings
Kept my bearings non-grounded
Liquid language, kept frozen forty ounces
How many MC's know who Faust is?
Pardon original
Manuscript fit text type tailored suit
Felt effect at root through vein type herron you shoot
Euphoric, saw banks of Tigris and Euphrates
Fertile crescents hold more lessons taught by deities
Consciousness is leaving me
Seen that same sage turn page on habitual, perform tectonic rituals
Broke abacus to calculate coordinates
But can't afford rent, it makes no sense
Forgot our days in shackles? You concentrate on battles
I lecture graduates, discussing Kant 'til they leave baffled
