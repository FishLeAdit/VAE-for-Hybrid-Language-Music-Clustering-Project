If time is just illusion
How can we come to conclusion now?
Will a window into my mind become a door?
Walk through and see before its too late
Things you hold so dear, I don't understand
Can soon disappear
What's this magical side of me?
Bleeding river to the sea
Horizon at dusk so pale so serene
Falcons of flight into infinity
Things you hold so dear, I don't understand
Can soon disappear
What's this magical side of me?
Bleeding river to the sea
Horizon at dusk
So pale so serene
Falcons of flight into infinity
