VERSE 1
One blessed instant, thought I'd laid my battles down
But once again it's time to move along
Though my body's aching
I spent my time, my precious time
When time was all I waited for
Scaling every dizzy height
To see what lay ahead
And they say that strength lies in the heart
I say it's in my wayward attitude
The gypsy's mark engraved upon my brow
VERSE 2
With all my secret wishes thrown upon the wind
Some come true and others never will
And some I can't remember
I lost my love, my precious love
When love was all I counted on
I got too busy hunting down what I held in my hand
And they say that strength lies in the bone
I say it's in my stony attitude
I walk away and won't be turned around
CHORUS
Stand by the roadside, facing the headlights
Wait for the break of dawn
Stand by the roadside, facing the headlights
Wait for the break of dawn
VERSE
One battle lost and yet another battle's won
Now's the time to hitch up and be strong
Though my heart is breaking
We move into those vacancies
And never really come to see
Our craving runs much deeper than we are prepared to go
And tonight I need a star to guide me home
I see the moon is on the run
I travel light and won't be far behind
CHORUS
Stand by the roadside, facing the headlights
Wait for the break of dawn
Stand by the roadside, facing the headlights
Wait for the break of dawn
