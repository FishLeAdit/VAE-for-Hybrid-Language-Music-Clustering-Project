Lie to my ears, lie to my ears
And tell me everything I'm dying to hear
I fear what I love, and love what I fear
We aren't the same motherfucker, you aren't real and I am
Lie to my ears, lie to my ears
And tell me everything I'm dying to hear
I fear what I love, and love what I fear
We aren't the same motherfucker, you aren't real and I am

One man one mic, one plan one night
If failure is not an option I came here to do it right
I'ma finish what i started I dedicated my life
I'm putting my heart and soul in this every morning and night
One man one mic, one plan one night
If failure is not an option I came here to do it right
I'ma finish what i started I dedicated my life
I'm putting my heart and soul in this every morning and night

Won't go down without a struggle, won't go down without a fight
If visualizing the struggle, you're too focused on the prize
You and me are not alike, get that through your fucking mind
I'm a real motherfucker, your a motherfucking clown
God bless, think fast
Pour a cup, drink that
Black out, get mad
Never regret what you ain't had
It's never good as it seems, and never really as bad
All these hollywood rappers are just a trend and a fad
I'm wondering if this life, will actually come together
But fuck it cause I do better under pressure I love it
People got hella false images, misconstrued judgements
I'm working till the day I'm in a casket with a tux
I'm a savage foot of bucks
Plus I'm passionate as fuck
If they laughing imma pass them till they leaking out they guts
Keep your opinion to yourself I just don't give a fuck (haha)
Uh, yeah I just don't give a fuck

Lie to my ears, lie to my ears
And tell me everything I'm dying to hear
I fear what I love, and love what I fear
We aren't the same motherfucker, you aren't real and I am
Lie to my ears, lie to my ears
And tell me everything I'm dying to hear
I fear what I love, and love what I fear
We aren't the same motherfucker, you aren't real and I am

One man one mic, one plan one night
If failure is not an option I came here to do it right
I'ma finish what I started I dedicated my life
I'm putting my heart and soul in this every morning and night
One man one mic, one plan one night
If failure is not an option I came here to do it right
I'ma finish what I started I dedicated my life
I'm putting my heart and soul in this every morning and night

I think on another galaxy
What the fuck is reality
This industry is really fucking with my personality
Everyday is the same, yet at the same time is different
I'm living in hell conditions, indirectly imprisoned
Everything but my creative mind
I never wait around
Random people hang me but in person they don't make a sound
We out here doing wrong, till me motherfucking fine
Look, money doesn't talk man, the motherfucking grind does
Dress from my brain, everyday I'm trying to find drugs
That help me take the pain away but only fucking time does
Lies and regrets trying to run away from the stress
Shit, maybe I'll finally find peace when I'm dead

One man one mic, one plan one night
If failure is not an option I came here to do it right
I'ma finish what i started I dedicated my life
I'm putting my heart and soul in this every morning and night
One man one mic, one plan one night
If failure is not an option I came here to do it right
I'ma finish what i started I dedicated my life
I'm putting my heart and soul in this every morning and night
