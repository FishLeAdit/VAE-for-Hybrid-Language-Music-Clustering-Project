Sweet as a teenage dream
Eating a purple tangerine
Sitting in a wheelchair telling you everything I’ve ever seen
Life is ice cream, at night I scream
The terror is the narrative
How about me and you share this fish I caught at the lake?
One more card trick to test your fate
Test your might, have a bite
Let’s be friends, let’s not fight
I lay on ice and gilded splinters
Rosy-cheeked women in the winter
Short skirts in the summer
My number one plunder
It’s all a pipe dream
Life’s a nice dream till you wake up and die
Cyanide girls eat humble pie
Nice guys let her finish first and bring her dogs liverwurst
It’s written in the dirt
Sitting on a perch
Spread your wings
I couldn’t even think of ten things I hate about you
It’s like red rings on PS2’s
Death brings a cup of beetle juice
Do you drink it? Don’t overthink it
Be a questioner
I shot the sheriff but I didn’t shoot the messenger

Awe boy, oh boy
This is your world that we’re here to enjoy
Awe boy, oh boy
This is your world that we’re here to enjoy (who's world is this?)
Awe boy, oh boy
This is your world that we’re here to enjoy (who's world is this?)
I'm just taking up oxygen
Pull up at the wind-up space, Height, hop on in!

It's all yours, from the woods to the shores
As said by troubadours on the union hall floors
Now I came here to represent the ultimate act
The rhymes got 'em all to react
I'm in your mind
Breaking through the wall to shine, times two
On the one, clowns propel down the mountain and run
We drive the vans straight to the sun
I hit the friendy's in Trenton with five scoops
Dive deep on these beats with live loops
I'm in your world with an army of troops
We put the jams on tape, boys are buying the dupes
The Super got you on the tips of your toes
We crawl out of a skull and rock shows
We dip out to where nobody knows
John Height on the mic where the wool grass grows
Waiting on 'em with the Megatron bombs, stay calm
Make a rapper move to Guam
But it's your world, and I digress
Let me close up shop and clean up this mess

Awe boy, oh boy
This is your world that we’re here to enjoy
Awe boy, oh boy
This is your world that we’re here to enjoy (who's world is this?)
Awe boy, oh boy
This is your world that we’re here to enjoy (who's world is this?)
