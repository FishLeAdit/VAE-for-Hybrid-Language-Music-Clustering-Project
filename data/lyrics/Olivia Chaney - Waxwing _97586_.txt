Waxwing, waxwing, what do you bring
From the frozen north?
Waxwing, waxwing, we've been waiting on you

I bring the amber that I have gathered
On the northern seashore
For the hatchlings I have fathered for thee

I've been underground where wyverns are bound
And where gold and jewels abound
These I hoarded under my berry-brown wings


We have no need, no need of your amber
Likewise your gold and your jewels
There is no true beauty in things of no use

And waxwing, waxwing, my only asking:
Tether the breezes so cruel, and
Keep my young well-feathered and their bellies full

Waxwing, waxwing, what will you do
When your days are far enough through? And
When at last grim death comes knocking on you

I can do nothing but fly in the wake of my kin
I will soar upward, undaunted, and die on the wing
I'll die in the canyon of echoes, you'll still hear me sing
And still I will give to you all the things I bring
