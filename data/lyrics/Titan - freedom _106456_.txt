We are the hunters
We are the hunters
We are the hunters
No soul can say they’ve died in vain
Not until the end, when the final arrow meets the battlefield
How can we win? Our foe is gigantic
But deep within we’re just as barbaric
Wielding the blades of Gloria, we’re made for victory
Only we dare to bear these wings on our backs
We have all carved an oath into our hearts, beating in unity
As our voices form the battle cry of the free
We were born for the skies with these Wings of Freedom
(they are the prey and we are the hunters) x2
Finally we march in victory
This is our first Gloria
Oh my friend
Let’s toast to victory when we meet again
Let's toast to victory when we meet again
No soul can say they’ve died in vain
Not until the end, when the final arrow meets the battlefield
How can we win? Our foe is gigantic (x2)
How can we win? How can we win?
Wielding the blades of Gloria, we’re made for victory
Only we dare to bear these wings on our backs
We have all carved an oath into our hearts, beating in unity
As our voices form the battle cry of the free
We were born for the skies … with these Wings of Freedom
