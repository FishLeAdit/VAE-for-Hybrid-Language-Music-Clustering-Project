By the time that we all go deaf, I know that we'll find a cure for it, yeah
People say that we'll die someday, but we just don't believe it
Long before we are old and gray, we'll find a way to beat it
Fight against physical decay, keep our bodies breathing
By the next quarter century we won't even need them
So shoot the supplements into our veins so we can reprogram our genes
And let the nanobots swim through our brains to keep our neurons sharp and clean
There's not a problem that we cannot solve with our technology
Just as long as we can stay alive until the singularity
Maybe you think we're mental
But if you doubt anything we say, check out our man's credentials
Our evolution is underway, and it's exponential
There's no reason to be afraid
We'll shoot the supplements into our veins so we can reprogram our genes
And let the nanobots swim through our brains to keep our neurons sharp and clean
And we will all transcend biology and merge with our machines
Just as long as we can stay alive until the singularity
So play it loud, turn up the kick
Cause by the time that we lose our hearing, we'll have a fix for it
So play it loud, crank it up to ten
Cause by the time that our ears are broken, we'll have no use for them
