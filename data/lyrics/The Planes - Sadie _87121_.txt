Christians in clothespins, great prophets break stride
Down here, dear captain, your past tense is my pretense
The beats, the sounds
The remix, the fine lines
The beats, the sounds
(Blues for the martyrs for now)
The remix, the fine lines
The beats, the sounds
The remix, the fine lines
(But can you hear dissolving like I do, like I do?)
The things in my head
Oh, the things in my head
(One foot in the jet stream, all my arms around the roads)
The part of my brain I've been trying to kill
(That lead me nowhere, to I don't know where)
Leaves me spitting out teeth, spitting out teeth
(While deprogramming presumption)
The part of my brain I've been trying to kill
Leaves me spitting out teeth, spitting out teeth
Spitting out teeth, spitting out teeth
Your memory is like sand
And no one wants a, no one wants a kiss
No one wants a kiss from blue lips
No one wants a kiss from blue lips
No one wants a kiss
From blue lips
And what frequency does my mind ride on?
So ride on, right on, ride on, right on, ride on
Why does the static go, why does the static go
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on?
It's your stiff-jointed routine
It's your stiff-jointed routine
And it's your concaved life
And it's your concaved life
Of they murdered you
And what frequency does my mind ride on?
(And they murdered)
Why does the static go on and on?
(And they murdered)
Why does the static go on and on?
On and on
(It's murder, it's murder, it's murder, it's murder
It's murder, it's murder, it's murder, it's murder)
