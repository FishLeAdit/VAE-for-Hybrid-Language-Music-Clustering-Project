Sun is shining, I'm not trying to be what you want me to be
Yes, I'm lying 'cause I'm shy, and I do not want you
To see my thoughts because they're tangled in a web
Yeah, you heard what I said

There's music in the background
And now rain falls on the roof
I'm trying to be polite
But I think I should give you the truth

Sitting at the table, staring at you while you stare at me
Making idle chit-chat while the night moves on
You know that it takes two of us to open up our hearts
To understand the parts

That seem so secretive
That seem so distant and aloof
I'm trying to be polite
But I think I should give you the truth

It always ends this way
I always wanna say
In an ideal world you'd tell me
Why you cannot sleep at night
In an ideal world you'd come to me
And you would hold me tight

Friday night, this dinner party seems to be going quite well
If I just mind my business then I will look like
A normal hostess, but I just wanna see inside your mind
Show yours and I'll show mine

There's music in the background
And now rain falls on the roof
I'm trying to be polite
But I think I should give you the truth
