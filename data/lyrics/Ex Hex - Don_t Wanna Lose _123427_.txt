If you listen close, you might hear the sound
Well, I would never let you down
I thought you were a man of action
Come on, baby, come on, give me a little reaction

I don’t wanna lose your love
It’s in my hand, it’s just a question of
If you’re gonna stop messing around
You better hurry up, don’t let me down

Well, you keep telling me it won’t be long
Well, that’s not right and that’s not wrong
Come on, talk to me, baby, and don’t be so cold
Your kingdom comes from actions and not from being bold

I don’t wanna lose your love
It’s in my hand, it’s just a question of
If you’re gonna stop messing around
You better hurry up, don’t let me down

My perception is growing dim
There’s no way to lose and no way to win
I’m not gonna stay down
Goodbye to dark days that surround

I don’t wanna lose your love
It’s in my hand, it’s just a question of
If you’re gonna stop messing around
You better hurry up, don’t let me down

My perception is growing dim
There's no way to lose, no way to win
I'm not gonna stay down
Goodbye to dark days that surround
