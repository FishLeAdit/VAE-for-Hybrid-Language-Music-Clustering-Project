It didn't work out like I had planned
But it did work out better than I thought it would
Lots, lots better
Way, way, way better
You hurt my feelings more than once
And made me feel bad more than twice
I thought if I made you jealous
You might want me more or treat me better
One million kisses for one million girls
And no kisses left for you
One million kisses for one million girls
And I did it all for you
It didn't work out like I had planned
You didn't even care
You didn't treat me any better
But I don't even care
One million kisses for one million girls
And no kisses left for you
One million kisses for one million girls
And I did it all for you
And me
