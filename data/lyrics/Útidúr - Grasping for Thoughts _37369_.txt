Sun is in the air
And I've been going everywhere
Taking my time
Gathering thoughts
One stroke at a time
A million miles from everywhere
Careless for a while
I swallow my smile
Sounds like a storm
Tastes just like Hennessy
I'll have another
To break in to my skull
Ash is in the air
Oh, I've been burning all my books
I'll start again
The ink has not dried
