If all that I got won't change my fate
Will my heart stray further from the light? Yeah
I couldn't find the way searching in vain
So take it for what you think it's worth
One step could cost your prayer

Mm, devils in the city
Mm, devils in the city
Don't make no mistake, girl
Mm, devils in the city
Stuck here with nowhere to go
(The devils and their voices)

Show me your faith and dedication
I'll give you everything you want
You know I'm never letting you down
(The devils and their voices)
Don't ever settle for illusions
I got all that you want
So let me deep inside of your heart

Mm-mm, yeah
Put on some music, pedal to the metal out the city
Out in Pacific, hear the wave breakin', got to need it
I'm just being honest, I was just born like that
That's how we all got here, I be just flowing like that
I know my place and know my role, never got lost
Just explored through my vision, kept my eyes closed
Enjoy the moment, this life that I chose
Enjoy the moment, let's see how that goes

Mm, devils in the city
Mm, devils in the city
Don't make no mistake, girl
Mm, devils in the city
Stuck here with nowhere to go
(The devils and their voices)

Show me your faith and dedication
I'll give you everything you want
You know I'm never letting you down
(The devils and their voices)
Don't ever settle for illusions
I got all that you want
So let me deep inside of your heart

Show me your faith and dedication
I'll give you everything you want
You know I'm never letting you down
Don't ever settle for illusions
I got all that you want
So let me deep inside of your heart
