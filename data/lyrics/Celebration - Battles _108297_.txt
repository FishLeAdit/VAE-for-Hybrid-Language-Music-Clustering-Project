I feel the force
All at once
To ride this lightnin' down
On a pale horse ride right noooooooooooow
If it’s not in your heart
Say it right from start now
And if it’s all in your head
Run to me instead love
There’s nothing here to see
If it’s not in your heart
Say it right from start now
And if it’s all in your head
Run to me instead love
Change, change could be fine
Just guarantee I don’t lose my mind
There, there will be blood
There will be blood between the lines
Oh, so I drink the vine, bathe naked in sunshine
Oh why must battles take so long?
I’ll be strong
Tonight’s the night we’ll be as one
Look towards the future so long
I’ll be strong x 2
Tonight’s the night we’ll be as one
Look towards the future so long x 2
Why must battles so long?
I’ll be strong…
