It's now forever and how
There's no turning back now
And which one of us won?
Or did we both lose
Tattered in our new clothes, uh huh
And keeping our space
But we are still fond, after all
Thats happened
I drink and swear it's shame
Still you care about me
How could you put up with it
When i ain't worth shit
I'm always gone all the time
But remembered to lock the doors
But we are still fond, after all
Thats happened
I know sometimes I tick you off
I should really think before i talk
Just take my word it was just a joke
You know I'll never leave you dear
Because all of my stuff is here
I come home, cuz I know you're there
Asleep in our bed
And it will go on that way
After all that's happened
Cuz we are still fond
After all that's happened
Cuz we are still fond
After all that's happened
