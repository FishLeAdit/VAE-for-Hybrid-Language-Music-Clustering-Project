Caffeine and lack of real sleep
Knees deep in gasoline
Ask me if I'm afraid to speak
'Cause my words make heat
Which streets the one we meet at?
Can't keep my feet to the beat of yours
Read me from a map of the town
And I'll lay my head down
Crosswalk, we stop and wait for the light to change us
Talk more and compensate for all my silence
Hands wrapped in hands we're ready
Slow down baby we got the town map handy inside our heads
And I'll lay my head down
Meet me at the pretty lights time of day
Where the pretty lights give me a pretty face
Baby stay with me until we can't see
No more 'til we can't see no more
We glowed hard now we're dark for sure
Take hold of my arm at the elbow and we'll go
And I'll lay my head down
I'm always almost there
