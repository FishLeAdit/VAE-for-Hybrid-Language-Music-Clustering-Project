Oh, honey
Never wanna be
Didn't wanna be that kind of guy
Oh, honey
Didn't wanna see
Didn't wanna see you break down and cry

Yeah, I'm sorry that I didn't understand
Yeah, I'm sorry that I didn't hold your hand
I'm sorry, honey, I broke your heart all up again
And I'm sorry that I let you down again

Oh, honey
Never wanna be
Didn't wanna be that kind of guy
Oh, honey
I didn't wanna see
Never wanna see you cut your arms and 

Yeah, I'm sorry I got tear stains in your clothes
Yeah, I'm sorry that I didn't hold you close
I'm sorry, honey, I broke your heart all up again
Yeah, I'm sorry that I let you down again
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Think about it, baby, all the time
Seeing old pictures when we seemed sublime
You know you see me turn away and back
It's driving me insane
The fire in my head

Yeah, I'm sorry that I didn't understand
Yeah, I'm sorry that I couldn't be your man
If I had known
If I could change back then
Then I wouldn't ever let you down again
I let you down again
I let you down again
I let you down again
Let you down in the end
