The drop that spills here now from this mighty knoll
Will land in the ground and seed a giant oak
In time, I'll climb to the top, I swear I'll never come down
I'll try to turn the world from 'bove the ground
Rotate ever so slowly on charming novelties
And just be thankful that I have empowered this tree
A leash of leaves like a crown around your kind
And try to forgive from up on high

The birds have grown to hate me, for I've swindled their home
And your mouth slightly open chills me now to the bone
I hope you know I'm human, at least I am that
And whatever you thought, at least, at least I am that

I've seen past my own hand to the pride that enslaves me
I remember the swagger that forced me to leave
We could grip that day close to our chest
And hold it there, that burning need for rest
You'd read me like a mirror while'd you pump me so high
And search for new words to spell for you in the sky
You'd write your plea for me in the clouds
But with this oath I am bound

And the birds have grown to hate me, for I've swindled their home
And your mouth slightly open chills me now to the bone
I hope you know I'm human, at least I am that
But whatever you thought, at least, at least I am that
The birds have grown to hate me, for I've swindled their home
And your mouth slightly open chills me now to the bone
I hope you know I'm human, at least I am that
But whatever you thought, at least, at least I am that
The birds have grown to hate me, for I've swindled their home
And your mouth slightly open chills me now to the bone
And I hope you know I'm human, I at least I am that
But whatever you thought, at least, at least I am that
