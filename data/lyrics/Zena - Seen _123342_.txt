When I think of you
It just leaves me senseless
Like I'm deaf and blind
Nothing left to lose
It's all but a fantasy
But it's keepin' me alive
I think that it's love
Ooh, it's all that I'm dreamin' of
Though you're a thousand miles away
My only thought is you
Lookin' for answers
I'm headin' for your heart
Don't know what to do
If only you'll show me
Just show me where to start
I want you so bad
Hope my message comes true
I need a hand to get me through
A million for a moment with you
Too blind to see, this could be love
Inside of me, oh, I can't get enough
Hopin' I am right
'Cause a feelin' deep inside
Tellin' me that it's love
When I think of you
I'm takin' chances
Don't care about the price
Tell me what to do
Can't live on fantasy
It's killin' me inside
I want you so bad
Hope my message comes true
I need a hand to get me through
A million for a moment with you
Too blind to see, this could be love
Inside of me, no, I can't get enough
Hopin' I am right
'Cause a feelin' deep inside
Tellin' me that it's love
Too blind to see, this could be love
Inside of me, no, I can't get enough
Hopin' I am right
'Cause a feelin' deep inside
Tellin' me that it's love
Too blind to see, this could be love
Inside of me, no, I can't get enough
Hopin' I am right
'Cause a feelin' deep inside
Tellin' me that it's love
Too blind to see, this could be love
Inside of me, no, I can't get enough
Hopin' I am right
'Cause a feelin' deep inside
Tellin' me that it's love
This could be, this could be love
Am I too blind to see?
This could be, this could be love
