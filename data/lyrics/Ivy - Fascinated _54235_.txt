You've got me working so hard
You've got me down on my knees
You say you're falling apart
Look what you're doing to me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Nobody knows what you want
Nobody knows what you need
I barely get a response
Look what you're doing to me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm fascinated
So fascinated
I'm fascinated, oh woo oh
A promise we made ourselves
To never care at all
And I know you'll never tell
Tell me how to break down these walls
Oh oh oh oh oh
Tell me how to break down these walls
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm fascinated
So fascinated
I'm fascinated, oh woo oh
Never turn up like we talked about
Never could tell how to read your mind
Never forgot what you're all about
In this lifetime, baby, you will be mine
You will be mine
In this lifetime, you will be mine
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm fascinated
So fascinated
I'm fascinated oh woo oh
