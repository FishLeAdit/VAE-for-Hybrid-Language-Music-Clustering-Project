In a bed amongst the storms
Where the tide will crush your bones
In the dirty water
We are slipping under
When the madness rings our ears
Will you drink away my tears?
I just wanna have you
Tell me that you want to

With your spark that turns to gold
And your eyes that bare your soul
Does it really matter?
Tell me what you're after

Lights out baby now
You're mine, don't fall behind
I love to feel you all o-ah-over, over
Don't care what you do
I'll light the fire inside of you
And we can make an explo-ah-o-sion

Ooh oh, oh-oh
Ooh oh, oh-oh

Even when you've gone too far
Will always have my heart
I will hold you closer
Than I ever held you

And he knows where this will be
But it's not too hard for me
You're the one to fight for
I will always want more

Lights out baby now
You're mine, don't fall behind
I love to feel you all o-ah-over, over
Don't care what you do
I'll light the fire inside of you
And we can make an explo-ah-o-sion

Ooh oh, oh-oh
Ooh oh, oh-oh
(Lights out)
Ooh oh, oh-oh
(I'm on fire)
Ooh oh, oh-oh
(I'm on fire)
Woo!
(Fire)
(Lights out)
(I'm on fire)
(I'm on fire)

Lights out baby now
You're mine, don't fall behind
I love to feel you all o-ah-over, over
Don't care what you do
I'll light the fire inside of you
And we can make an explo-ah-o-sion
Lights out baby now
You're mine, don't fall behind
I love to feel you all o-ah-over, over
Don't care what you do
I'll light the fire inside of you
And we can make an explo-ah-o-sion
