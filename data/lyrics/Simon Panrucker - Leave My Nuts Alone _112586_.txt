Every year on Christmas night
I give my nuts a check
I handle them so carefully
This year I got quite a fright
When I was mid inspect
Oh, it upset me terribly
To my dismay, it seems something ain't right
It looks like someone's come and had a bite
I don't know what to do
I wish my nuts were left unchewed
I'm angry and confused
Who would do this!
I don't think I would mind so much
If they had asked me first
But I gave no such consent!
They could have had a little touch
But this is so much worse
I've never been in such torment
Why couldn't they have left my nuts alonе
Now they've been munched all I can do is moan
I'll havе to live without
But I would have loved to crack one out
Now I just want to shout
Who's been gobbling my nuts, oh
Who's been gobbling my nuts?
Leave my nuts alone!
Leave my nuts alone!
Oh, who's been gobbling my nuts?
Who's been gobbling my nuts?
Leave my nuts alone!
Leave my nuts alone!
Oh, won't you leave my nuts in peace?
Please leave my nuts in peace!
Please don't leave my nuts in pieces!
Won't you leave my nuts in peace?
Please leave my nuts in peace!
Please don't leave my nuts in pieces!
Who's been gobbling my nuts, oh
Who's been gobbling my nuts?
Leave my nuts alone!
Leave my nuts alone!
Oh, who's been gobbling my nuts, oh
Oh, who's been gobbling my nuts?
Leave my nuts alone!
Leave my nuts alone!
Oh, who's been gobbling my nuts, oh
Oh, who's been gobbling my nuts?
Leave my nuts alone!
Leave my nuts alone!
Oh, who's been gobbling my nuts, oh
Oh, who's been gobbling my nuts?
Leave my nuts alone!
Leave my nuts alone!
Won't you leave my nuts in peace?
Please leave my nuts in peace!
Please don't leave my nuts in pieces!
Won't you leave my nuts in peace?
Please leave my nuts in peace!
Please don't leave my nuts in pieces!
Leave my nuts alone!
