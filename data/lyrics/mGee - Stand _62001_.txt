Ever lasting cyan globe
Of deserts, forests, mountains, seas
Ever changing and evolving
Cells to beings, seeds to trees
On and on she is sailing powerful and grand
All built up by countless tiny grains of sand
Ever turning tides and seasons
Whirls and twirls eternally
Every day we search for reasons
Throwing rocks into the sea
On and on mankind's fighting over shreds of land
Waves of time turning mountains into grains of sand
All will stay
We are forever today
Stories too great to be told
Unfold
Ever after our existence
She stays on her faithful track
Evеrything we have is borrowed
Wе will have to give it back
On and on we believe we hold it in our hands
We won't see we are nothing more than grains of sand
