Hey, I was freaking around doing some grown shit
With my old chick, met a brand new bitch
In my brand new whip, rocking brand new kicks
Looking so damn fly that's some brand new shit

In a brand new city with some dirty ass Chuck's
If you want to succeed better gather up your bucks
Let the haters pile up, I don't really give a fuck
If they start to jack my style, I'mma switch the style up
Setting trends never follow, getting head Sleepy Hollow
I'm a local name now but I said I'd be Apollo
If I just stay on my grind it's just a matter of time
Dropped five mixtapes and I'm still up in my prime
Been rhyming since I was nine, leaving critics behind
Only eighteen of millions of views up online
And the numbers don't lie, who the fuck's my competition?
In a minute they'll be missing it I bet they wife be listenin'
To my music on the reg, said she heard me on the web
First time I was in Chicago some random chick gave me head
And I came up on her titties so you know I love that city
Fuck a snap back, rock a fitted fifty-nine fifty

I was freaking around doing some grown shit
With my old chick, met a brand new bitch
In my brand new whip, rocking brand new kicks
Looking so damn fly that's some brand new shit

I said I pop these bottles and top models
Now I'm Popu-L-A-R as fuck damn baby look it up
Young superstar you ain't gotta look up
Everywhere I go I feel somebody give me the hook up
Went from nobody out onto sold out shows
And went from never getting them to too many hoes
I mean it's hard work and everyday I feel uncertainty
But certainly I hope that you admire all this currency
I came a long way from the umpire days
Grind pays and I just gave myself a raise
So while you look at me stupid
I'm out in Honolulu with a Mila Kunis you dufus
You're mad cause you probably hang out with Meg
And I got a model that's cleaning and cooking me bacon and eggs
Like damn, it's amazing how a year can go
Lately everyday been feeling like a miracle

I was freaking around doing some grown shit
With my old chick, met a brand new bitch
In my brand new whip, rocking brand new kicks
Looking so damn fly that's some brand new shit

I've been around the block and back, I'm the one to holla at
If you're looking for that crack to be laid out on the track
The torch is getting passed to that new up-and-comer
That young stunter who keep it one hundred that muhfucka
Who they hate to see succeed yeah they'd rather see me bleed
From the burbs but you know that I'm familiar with the streets
Paying bills and I'm eating off this music that I'm making
One of the hardest workers that God ever created
Time is never wasted it's spent plotting my rise
The ignorant ones disguise theyself pretending they lives
But up in my fucking eyes deep inside they know they not
I'm headed right for the top its all a part of my plot
Then ain't nobody gon' stop, I'm planning on taking over
My rhymes is getting colder with every year I get older
And I just ain't getting younger bitches quick to give they number
If you looking for the dopest up-and-comer I'm that motherfucker

I was freaking around doing some grown shit
With my old chick, met a brand new bitch
In my brand new whip, rocking brand new kicks
Looking so damn fly that's some brand new shit
