Hate it when my voice turns to TV static in your ears
Feels like I’ve been hearing crickets for years
But it’s only been an hour or so
Since I got here
And started chirping at you


Well confusion isn’t cool
I always turn into a fool
When I’m around you
Pretending to forget her name
(What was her name again?)
I don't know what I'm asking for
But I'm asking for it

Droning on all over the place
I’ve been buzzing round your face
Talking your ear off all night long
Grasping for straws or anything
That I can hold on to
Oh I’m gonna hold on to you
I’ll be your favorite guy
Your little housefly
And that’s when I
Asked if I could
Suck you dry
Like a parasite


I can taste the venom laced with the words in my mouth
Never realized just how quickly I was willing to take things south
And I can try to wash my words down
But this shit ain’t working

Well confusion isn’t clean
Am I as twisted as I seem?
And you know I didn’t mean to
Kiss you last night
But I kind of wanted to
I don’t know what I’m asking for
But I’m asking for it

Droning on all over the place
I’ve been buzzing round your face
Talking your ear off all night long
Grasping for straws or anything
That I can hold on to
Oh I’m gonna hold on to you
I’ll be your favorite guy
Wear me out until I die
And that’s when I slipped
And I ate shit
Swear the tile flipped


Am I talking too much?
Am I blinking too much?
Moving my hands too much?
Am I thinking too much?
Wasting my time on all the things
I shouldn’t give a shit about
Wish I could molt all my skin from my body
And I feel like I have a million legs or something
That are tripping up and over each other
Banging my head up against a bright light
My photoreceptors are blurred
My speech is slurring
My social cues and my left antenna
Aren’t the only things that are broken
Now I’m lying here facedown on your bathroom floor
Drowning in a pool of my own saliva
Watch it leak and spew from my open maw
It tastes like vodka and torrential tropical punch Hi-C

Oh I see you
I see you staring at me
With that look on your
Face, face
Ah oh I see you
And I feel so ugly
I feel so fucking ugly
When I’m bugging you
