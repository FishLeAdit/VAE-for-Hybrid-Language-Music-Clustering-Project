What I thought was just a matter of conscience
Turned out to be a matter of luck
And what I should've done was just a matter of time
Turned out to be my dumb luck

Oh, Nicole told me
Oh, Nicole told me
Oh, Nicole told me
And I now know that she was right
Last night I did a foolish thing and
I now regret it
The word is out and so am I
And I know that she won't forget it

I had a strange feeling
Like all this had happened before
Right down to the smallest detail
Just like it had all happened before

I was told there are good things to come
For those who will wait
And it sounded so good, the way that she said it
Oh, I just couldn't wait

The first thing I saw was her face
And then I saw her back
And after I had seen her eyes
Well, I knew that she would not come back
