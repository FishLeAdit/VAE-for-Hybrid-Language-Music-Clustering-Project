Lily Moon I see your face I sit inside without a trace
Trail behind and ride your wake, and lily white
Yet blushing crimson in the night
Will you be leaving with the light?
And creeping over with the shadows at my side
The moonlight yields the sigh
I step and turn while you stick feathers in my back
This flying lesson leaves a track

Darkness burns away
Lit with shoulders burning fire feather quills
The darkness burns away
Darkness burns away
Lit with shoulders burning fire feather quills
Darkness burns away


Lily Moon I see your face inside these eyes my own will trace
Yet suddenly erased
Such lily white did spread it's arms out to the night
These arms did clasp and sigh
And half asleep I did try, try to hold piercing grass
But it was grey, it was grey, it was grey, it was grey
Memory, save my sight
Memory, come back to me

Darkness burns away
Lit with shoulders burning fire feather quills
The darkness burns away
Darkness burns away
Lit with shoulders burning fire feather quills
Darkness burns away

Then I saw twisted trunk, scattered mold
Black and speckled spotted stone
Hailing in with the cold wind whistle past and oh!
Dancing green pieced between wall of streets of ancient oak
Made of water quilt below, grown of lightning, breath, and bone

Darkness burns away
Lit with shoulders burning fire feather quills
The darkness burns away
Darkness burns away
Lit with shoulders burning fire feather quills
Darkness burns away
