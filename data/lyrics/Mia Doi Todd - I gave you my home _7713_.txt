I gave you my home
I gave you my hope
The walls, they surround us
Unbound us. We are one
I gave you my heart
I gave you my art
All of creation
Is here in my kitchen
Soup is on
Lover, lover
Come on over
You gave me your home
You gave me your hope
Built us an altar
Of bronze and redwood timber
The stairs are done
You gave me your heart
You gave me your art
Drawings and flowers
And so many hours
Night has come
Lover, lover
Roll on over
We woke up from dreams
Took turns at the sink
We crawl back into bed
There are eggs for an omelette
If you're hungry
Lover, lover
Turn me over
