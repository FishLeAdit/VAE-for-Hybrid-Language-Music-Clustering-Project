I got caught up in some bullshit and almost gave up my dreams
Even had some trust issues with people up on my team
I went and questioned my confidence after I gave up trees
But now I'm back in the booth and once again I'm at peace
And once again I'm at peace, and once again I'm at peace
I got caught up in some bullshit and almost gave up my dreams

Pills for concentration, pills for motivation
Pills to keep me patient and pills to help me create shit
I'm addicted to this life, I'm living trying to fuck all types of women
Regardless their skin color, regardless of their religion
I be trying to paint a vision, vinyl scratching, records skipping
Keep my distance from women who hella timid
I'm proving to be the next greatest thing out of everyone, A to Z
Producers sending me beats and I hope my enemies bleed
I'm feeding em' helpless rappers, y'all some fucking selfish bastards
If money is all you after, that just shouldn't play a factor
I'm cracking up at your ignorance, lately I've been a pessimist
When I go out in public, I'm turning heads like the exorcist
Devilish thoughts I'mma bad son, trust and never had fun
Really needing sleep, I lost like ten pounds in the last month
Used to always pass blunts, till I quit smoking
But now I'm all out of focus, I thought my shit smelt like roses

I got caught up in some bullshit and almost gave up my dreams
Even had some trust issues with people up on my team
I went and questioned my confidence after I gave up trees
But now I'm back in the booth and once again I'm at peace
And once again I'm at peace, and once again I'm at peace
I got caught up in some bullshit and almost gave up my dreams

I'm trying to harness my thoughts, lately I'm feeling so lost
Feeling unwanted by the world, but someone tell me the cost
The cost of paying the price, I never prayed in my life
But right now I could really desperately use a sign
I gotta know whats in store, I feel like floating to shore
Cause I'm lost in sea, mentally and I just can't take no more
All of my feelings ignored, I used to be easy going
Can't figure out my emotions and when it raise it reporse
Didn't go to college to tour, but was that such a mistake
Ain't never been more afraid, I feel like going insane
Tearing my hair out it's crazy, my father never been lazy
And then the apple don't fall far from pops to his babies
So just know that I'm hard working and that's for damn certain
And I know I never really been one of the nicest of persons
And these feelings really irking me, there's something that occurred to me
Half the people who heard of me don't even know me personally

I got caught up in some bullshit and almost gave up my dreams
Even had some trust issues with people up on my team
I went and questioned my confidence after I gave up trees
But now I'm back in the booth and once again I'm at peace
And once again I'm at peace, and once again I'm at peace
I got caught up in some bullshit and almost gave up my dreams
I got caught up in some bullshit and almost gave up my dreams
Even had some trust issues with people up on my team
I went and questioned my confidence after I gave up trees
But now I'm back in the booth and once again I'm at peace
