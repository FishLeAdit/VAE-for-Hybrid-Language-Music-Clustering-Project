I sold my blood to a hospital
But it wasn't very much blood
So they didn't give me much money
They didn't give me much
I thought that you might like this
Because it's got a shine to it
I know you like shiny things
So I will try to buy it up for you
And drive to you
I posed unclothed
For an artist in his home
But I couldn't hold it long enough
And he didn't like my body much
So he didn't give me much
I thought that you might like this
Because it's got a shine to it
I know you like shiny things
So I will try to buy it up for you
And drive
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
