Oh dinosaur, meteors aren't your friends
Oh dying man, write your will while you still can
America, have you forgot 'bout Rome?
My, you've gotten fat, but so have I... ugly and old
Terminally in love with you
Oh shallow seas, 'pologies for my friends
Oh shaking tree, why'd you speak in words that no one understands?
America, have you forgot 'bout Rome?
My, you've gotten fat, but so have I... ugly and old
Old stockholm syndrome
Stuck all alone, in love with detainment
Oh coliseum, filling your stands
With all your pagans
Terminally in love with you
Oh sickly dog, give a paw for the barbital
All, all of us there, all of the X's with a point
Bombs burst in the air, amen!
The scene was out of sight
Terminally in love with you
Terminally in love with you
Terminally in love with you (m-m-m-m-m-m-merica)
Terminally in love with you (m-m-m-m-m-m-merica)
Terminally in love with you
