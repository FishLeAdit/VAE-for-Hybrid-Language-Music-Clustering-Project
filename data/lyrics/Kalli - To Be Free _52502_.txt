It's time we come together to fight and survive
Overthrow the controlling forces, the greed and the lies
Realize if this shit don't stop we're all gonna die
Come to our senses and recognize
The truth inside the lies
It's time we separate the brave men from the cowards
Unafraid to fight and die, freedom will be ours
Realize if this shit don't stop we're all gonna die
Come to our senses and recognize
The truth inside the lies
Spit it in my face, don't look me in the eye, do what's good for me
Life to my face while so many die, killing to be free
It's time we force the leaders to tell the truth or die
Admit their reckless engagement or pay the final price
Realize if this shit don't stop we're all gonna die
Come to our senses and recognize
The truth inside the lies
