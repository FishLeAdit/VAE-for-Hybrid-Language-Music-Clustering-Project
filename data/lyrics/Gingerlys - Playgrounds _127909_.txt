Skipping stones right behind you
Just stop because
You’re not a kid anymore
You’re not a kid anymore
You say "I mean"
You say "I mean"
You’re not a kid anymore
You’re not a kid anymore
All your friends they like the same things
Why can't you see?
You’re not a kid anymore
You’re not a kid anymore
In your head I'm afraid
Just to be at home
Alone
Meet you on our favorite playground
But nothing looks familiar
You’re not a kid anymore
You’re not a kid anymore
You say "I mean"
You say "I mean"
You’re not a kid anymore
You’re not a kid anymore
Know the place where friends will find you
Where will you be tomorrow?
You’re not a kid anymore
You’re not a kid anymore
In your head I'm afraid
Just to be at home
Alone
In my head you’re afraid
Just to be alone
In your head I'm afraid
Just to be at home
Alone
