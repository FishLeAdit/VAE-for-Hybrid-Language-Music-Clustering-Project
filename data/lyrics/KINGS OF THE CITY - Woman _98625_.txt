Woman
I was in the backseat of your car
Smoking with my old friends
Driving through the backstreets and the stars
Listening to old songs playing in the new world
Drinking to the ancient nights
Talking of a way we used to feel
When the sunlight, sunlight burnt our eyes
'Cause when the sunlight burnt our eyes
You were running through the 
I was dreaming of a future life
I was relatively new to life
Woman

Those days
Midsummer life, no shades
Glint in my eyes, she's down with danger
Then I raise her up, no close shaves
I was brave enough, smoked haze
Wakin' up, so dazed
Fast nights, slow days
So we made the most of playin' pro, blazin'
All our favourite tunes could be clocked at bars
And see the day, or watch it pass
Shit either way, I know I need to pay
If I sleep too late I'm stayin' up regardless
There's no sign that I was bored of life
'Cause I was born for livin' on the border line
We'll be there to cheat, death all time
Livin' carefree, the best sort of kind

'Cause when the sunlight burnt our eyes
You were running through the 
I was dreaming of a future life
I was relatively new to life
Woman

Think back my lady
You rode in a '96 black Mercedes
Late night chillin', window's tinted
Kiss you on your mouth with a cigarette in it
But most nights you'd be far away
You'd leave your car in the 
I'd site in the back with a bag of haze
And a bottle of Jim Beam, no Alizé
And a Big Mac man and a chip on my shoulder
Joked about kids when we older
Conversations were patient
And never spoken when sober
And my mates would take the piss
My statuses were based on chasing chicks
We were teenagers
Wasting the night away, misusing the light of day

'Cause when the sunlight burnt our eyes
You were running through the 
I was dreaming of a future life
I was relatively new to life
'Cause when the sunlight burnt our eyes
You were running through the 
I was dreaming of a future life
I was relatively new to life
