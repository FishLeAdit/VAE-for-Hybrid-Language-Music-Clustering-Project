I only rise when it's time for me to fuck or get high
Or when my ninth life dies and I'm up in the skies
Me and rhymes match perfect like devil and lies
He only wish he had purpose on a level of mines
God Jus Allah hurts, like natural birth
Without a dad or a nurse, can't imagine it worse
You're only mad in your verse, this my actual thirst
My simplest words, more than you can fathom at first
Go back to your church, hope your motherfuckin luck works
Dumb fucks like yourself just stuff earth
To me god takes time there's a waiting line
I can break your fucking faith like hate crime
You're so mere, I wish you'd disappear
The lake of fire burns red devils to crystal clear
I never went to sixth grade I skipped a year
Once I found I had a way in my brain to shift the gears

When my dogs hunt you, ain't no place safe you can run to
Monestary's or Mosques, none of them will want you
Your clock is ticking when death haunts you
And when the cannon blow you away your fam wonder where you gone to
Heaven or hell the eye swell from remembering
The day you got stopped like Singapore was an Indian
Save all the talk, cause when guns buck
Niggas get burnt alive like Joan of Arc
You can't stop a solider who's a known bi-polar
Epileptic dyslexic gun holder
You be dead for days till someone smell your odor
Bugs earth and air decomposure
And your friends told you chill before this just a graphic scene
You got more bitch in you than Maxin magazine
I pass Glocks to Bomshot
And me him and Jus Allah plot to spill blood like pom pot

The master builders
We buildin' on 5 pillars
Raise your sword in the name of the lord we snake killers
My rhymes are many signs for mankind to marvel
When I die I'm in the sky, in mansions made of marble
So imma' set it straight
Why would God hesitate
When I meditate and cause the holy shrine to levitate
Even when it rains
My thoughts remain sunny
I prance out of gardens with rivers flowing honey
We climb onto golden charretes
Only angels carry it
My dick swings low, you can call me sweet chariate
My pure beams of light
That could uphold the skies
Just one of the many blessings from the mighty the wise
Who gave you eyes ears nose mouth and hands to observe
You ingrate, little things you give in return
Come put your life on the line
Best believe I could hurt that
You'll rest eternally
Go take a motherfuckin' dirt nap
