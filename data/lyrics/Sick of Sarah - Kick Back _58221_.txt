So we’ll be taking our time
You know the backseat lovers
Want to watch you fall
Turn it over to the flip side
Looking for your answers
Your route to crawl
And you’ll tell all your friends
You met a little someone special
Who likes to dance
But they’ll be waiting for the kickbacks
Ripping on the rejects
They call their friends
And we sang
No it's not that we can’t feel
We're just hoping that it’s real
And it’s not a place in time
We're just hoping that you’ll find
Something we might have left behind
And you know it's better in the back
And you’re waiting for me
And I'll give anything you’ll ask of
Anything you wanted
As long as it’s free
Oh and I'll tell all of my friends
I met a little someone special
Who likes to dance
But they’ll be waiting for the kickbacks
Rippin’ on the rejects
I call my friends
And we sang
No it's not that we can’t feel
We're just hoping that it’s real
And it’s not a place in time
We're just hoping that you’ll find
Something we might have left behind
Tell me do you like it?
Tell me do you like it?
Tell me do you like it?
It's not that we can’t feel
We're just hoping that it’s real
And it’s not a place in time
We're just hoping that you’ll find
Something we might have left behind
It's not that we can’t feel
We're just hoping that it’s real
And it’s not a place in time
We're just hoping that you’ll find
Something we might have left behind
It's not that we can’t feel
We're just hoping that it’s real
And it’s not a place in time
We're just hoping that you’ll find
Something we might have left behind
