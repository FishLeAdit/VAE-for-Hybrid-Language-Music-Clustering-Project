You were the very first one
You were the first one

You are the very first one
Making out all over me
You set my nervous hands on
So take me more, you'll take me

You were the first one
And I'd like to say
You were the first one
And I'd like you to stay

When I met your stunning love
Your lucid eyes came to life
Come on down to ninety-four
You tell me more and I'll tell you

You were the first one
And I'd like to say
You were the first one
And I would like to say

Take us down, down on the floor
It's piping hot, so smooth and warm
Tell and show, whose bread is whose?
And I will show that I will be like

You were the first one
And I'd like to say
You were the first one
And I'd like you to stay
You were the first one
And I'd like to say
You were the first one
Please, please, please go away
You were the first one
I'll love you someday
You will be the last one
Please come back someday

You were the very first one
You were the first that I ever did
All the time and all the day
Into your eyes, deeper the day
Perfect teeth in '94
Kiss me more and I will kiss you more

You were the first one
And I'd like to say
You were the first one
And I'd like you to stay
You were the first one
I love you someday
You will be the last one
Please come back someday

Number one
The very first one
