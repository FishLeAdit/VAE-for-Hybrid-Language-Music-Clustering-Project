Baby I don't feel the same
When I've got you on my mind
I can't deny that I want you baby
More than just sometimes

'Cause you look like a sunset
On an Arizona sky
So light me up like a cigarette
With that fire in your eyes

And burn me down slowly
Girl take your time
Burn me down slowly
Tonight
Yeah tonight
Burn me down slow

Here I am alone again
Counting down the time
I can't deny that I don't pretend
That you're already mine

'Cause you look like a sunset
On an Arizona sky
So light me up like a cigarette
With that fire in your eyes

And burn me down slowly
Girl take your time
Burn me down slowly
Tonight
Yeah tonight
Burn me down slowly

Girl take your time
Burn me down slowly
Tonight
Yeah tonight
Burn me down slow
