The seventh ray, somber on a Sunday
The years been spent living the halfway
Our guess is not enough
Place your own until it's flux
Our guess is not of worth
Place your own pint star of firsts
The seventh ray, somber on a Sunday
The years been spent living the halfway
There's zero chance for zero wonder
I work inside the realms of color
