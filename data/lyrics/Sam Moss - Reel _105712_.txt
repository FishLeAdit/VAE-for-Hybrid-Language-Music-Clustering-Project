Yo
You rappers cheap thrills I’m a monster for real
I'ma beast these boys I got a licence to ill
Grim reaper call the preach play the organs
Beat killer blank face Demigorgan
My scare tactics automatic your fear I transmit
Terror addict turn beats zombies kill em tragic
Flabbergasted by you rappers I’m kinda manic
Maniac beat comes on I get to spazzing
Little Shop of Horror feed me beats please
How I break this sickness down dis ease
What a heathen no weakness I kill these
Bars flip them crazy this a pair of normal activities
Give me any beat any time I cause freight
Give me any beat turn beast lurking at night
Superman with evil in eyes I burn bright
Decease beats mummy wrap king goodnight
Niggas lying oh on tracks yall Thunder Cat
After me you’ll have to brush off defeat
Where’s the welcome mat
All that capping in your rapping muzzle that
Nightmare hands get to shacking it’s like rumble pack
Look I’m coming for top scare where’s Sullie at
Everything in my minds stone I got the vision scrap
I’m dope I need the time stone bring the 80’s back
They say I’m too cocky when I rap fuck that
I need mo carrots no baggage I’m GOAT status
I’m back killing my doggie style is more savage
I mean on beats I can’t be trusted I’m back stabbing
I’ll get you lifted arms crossed the chest I’m back cracking
Wait I’m blessing you with my presence my gifts rapping
Old head lifting heavy boxes I’m back spazzing
Hold on I said that before rewind that shit
Dagg namit relapse on this rap it’s a bad habit
Director talk it ends with a cut I’m bout action
It’s a wrap Martin reference yall get to stepping
Sam D. I’m not the nigga you wanna rap at
I might snap turn this track Celebrity Match
Beetle Juice Candy Man Boogie Man
Say my name I'll put you to sleep Sandman
Wolf Man look man how I cook a hater
I body snatch any beat Mind Flayer
Are you afraid of the dark I gotta ask
Scary when I dance on beats he did the mash
Are you afraid of the dark I gotta ask
Dance on any beat he did the monster mash
No quarantine for this pen head I’m a hell raiser
Look I been to hell and back I re spawned greater
Mom birth Rosemary’s Baby I’m no good
Been struggling all my life these Tales from the Hood
Freddy Kruger how I maneuver such scary dreams
Kill shit like Jason welcome to Halloween
This flows through my skeleton jack bad dreams
Fuck I’m bugging Uggie Buggie this is Halloween
That hammer spit I’m too legit I’m a real problem
Yall scrubs I’m dead sick I need real doctors
In the lab Frankenstein made Eddie Munster
Like Krum I go above heads AHHH Real Monsters
