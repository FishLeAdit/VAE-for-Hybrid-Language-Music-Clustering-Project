Run past the rivers, and run past the seas
Ooh, I don't wanna
Ooh, I don't wanna go back
When it rains, I save my pennies
When it pours, I toast to staying dry
Ooh, I don't wanna
Ooh, I don't wanna go back
Don't, don't, don't mess around
Because I've got eyes all over town
Eyes all over town
Eyes all over town
Eyes all over town
It's a joke, to all my friends it's a joke
But the joke is on me
Ooh, it makes me nervous
Ooh, it makes me wanna crawl back
So I run to the water, that siren's bell it tolls for me
Ooh, it makes me nervous
Ooh, it makes me nervous
Ooh, it makes me, ooh it makes me wanna dive in
Don't, don't, don't mess around
Because I've got eyes all over town
Eyes all over town
Eyes all over town
Eyes all over town
I just wanna forget
I just wanna forget
My mistakes and regrets, my mistakes and regrets
Don't, don't, don't mess around
Because I've got eyes all over town
Eyes all over town
Eyes all over town
Eyes all over town
Eyes all over town
