Yeah yo...Uh uh
Test test word
Gynus...Hi-Rez you already know

Hey my mind 'bout to explode
Somebody roll somethin' up and get stoned
Throw me a bone, I need a clone just to make everyone happy I know
Never gon' fold I'm taking the pot
Speaking of pot I've been smoking a lot
You better watch out uh haha
Stay in your lane or take a different route
Smoking on sour just to forget all the stress I've been having
I'm lapping these rappers who wack
Ya'll just some faggots rapping 'bout money and stacks
Bitches and bottles and crack
Me - I spit crack, bag it and sell it with tax
Smoking that bomb like Iraq
Abundance of weed it's taller than Shaq, it's taller than Shaq
Feeling so antsy, feelin' like I can't breathe
Like I'm laying on the floor under a stampede
All these critics can get fucked no Plan B
I'm separated from the haters like Pangaea
Got a little hope got a little bit of dope
If it doesn't work out I'll be hanging from a rope
I ain't rapping for the dough, I ain't rapping for the money
I ain't rapping for the hoes, I ain't rapping for the hunnies
I'm doing this to live and just escape when I'm pissed always patient
Now I'm sick of fuckin' waitin' for this shit
I'm blazing a bunch of piff I'm chasing what don't exist
I'm praying for better days cause I've been feeling the prison of my own mind
Feeling like these long time nuts you can hold mine
I've been spitting coke lines take it to your sinus
Killin' haters with kindness only smoking the finest
Every day I'm grindin', every day I'm grindin' bitch

For the motherfuckin' world ho, for my girl ho
I ain't deserving
I'm out here motherfuckin' solo with my eyes so low
I'm far from a perfect person
Every motherfuckin' day I wake up pissed off
Feeling like I'm worthless
All these other rappers out here poppin' Crystal
Fuck that God gave me a purpose
Once upon a time there was a guy who died
And he lived happily ever after
Once upon a time there was a guy who died
And he lived happily ever after x2

Mentally lost but at what cost
What's all this for? still I want more
Every day wakin' up pissed and ignored
The Reaper is knocking don't answer the door
Never been poor, never been rich
Emotions and feelings are always so mixed
Go hide your bitch, single as shit
Fuck every single relationship
Skip all the kissing and give me some brains
On top of that I've been going insane
Shackled and chained stay in your lane
Bitch I'm just so sick of playing your games
Speaking of game the game needed change
Not just somebody who looking for fame
Not saying names I go through pain
We ain't the same muhfucka you know
Sick and tired of feeling how I been feeling
Been killing myself in sacrifice when I know I'm the realest
Depression mean I'm the illest I'm a hero with a villainous spirit
I fear no evil, in my raps you can hear it
Explain what's in the way
I'm blazing a bunch of haze, I'm praying for better days
No longer am I afraid of being different
Surrounding myself with people with ambitions
Get the fuck up out my business shut the fuck up I'm mad now listen to me
Please from the 'burbs to the streets I'm a person of peace who'll serve any fiend
Who talkin' that good good rollin' a backwood jumping through my old hood
Wish a motherfucker would but they all talk
