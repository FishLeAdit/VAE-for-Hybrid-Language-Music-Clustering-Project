Good morning dear
I hope I didn't wake you too soon
Because my mind is growing tired
Too much thinking what I should do
I picture you out there
It must be beautiful this time of year
All those east coast leaves
Floating round like embers from burning trees
Well the weather out here's just the same
But the garden that you planted remains

Now it's only work
Each day bleeding into the next
Barely scraping by
I tire myself out just so I can rest
But rest it rarely comes
When it does I cannot go home
Because it's much too quiet
Seems that I'm not suited to being alone
And everyone around me has changed
But the garden that you planted remains

I think about you
Maybe more than I should
But the smoke is getting old
The drugs I'm taking aren't so good
So will you talk to me?
Even though you've had a late night
Because I need a little help
Baby, tell me I'll be alright
Cause everything around me has changed
But the garden that you planted remains
