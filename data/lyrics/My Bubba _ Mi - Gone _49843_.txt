Oh honey you're so strong like chili powder
In your arms, when you hold me in them
I never have a chance to get away
I'm with you when I'm gone
I walk the streets on my own
All night long
Oh honey you're so strong like chili powder in your arms
How do you make time to be so juicy
Like pineapple in the sun
And everybody knows
Pineapple-chili is what goes
Best together in this world
