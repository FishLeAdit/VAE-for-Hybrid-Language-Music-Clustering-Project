At the end of every week
They flood into our streets
Homogenized and oh so bleak
Got a hall pass from your job
Just to act like a fucking slob
Save 16 bricks for the façade
I hate the weekend
I hate, hate the weekend
I hate the weekend
I hate, hate the weekend
They were made for the working stiff
With a two day fun permit
Let loose like our life depends on it
At the end of every week
You're screaming in our streets
Work hard, play hard, business elite
I hate the weekend
I hate, hate the weekend
I hate the weekend
I hate, hate the weekend
Paint the rainbow shades of beige
Take down everything we made
The neighborhood walks home afraid
Cause they were made for the working stiff
With a two day fun permit
Let loose like your life depends on it
I hate the weekend
I hate, hate the weekend
I hate the weekend
I hate, hate the weekend
