Every note is an unfinished song
We're all in a cosmic sing-along
Sing-along, sing-along, sing-along

We're all in a cosmic sing-along
'Til the day is done
We're all in a cosmic sing-along
'Til the world is gone

Sing-along, sing-along, sing-along

Bells are ringing, gates are swinging
Sing along
Laughing voices, sudden noises
Sing along

Sing-along, sing-along, sing-along

Every note is an unfinished song
