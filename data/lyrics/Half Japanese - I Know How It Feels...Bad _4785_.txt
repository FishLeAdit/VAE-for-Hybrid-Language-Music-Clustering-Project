I think about you
But I shouldn't
Because you're already in love
I know
I wouldn't
Want you to
Break up
I never want to
Break up anybody
Because of me
I know how it feels. Bad
I shouldn't
But I can't help myself
I think about
You (Mary Jickling)
You (Joan Peterson)
You (Patti Lang)
You (Kathy Frasca)
You
The reason I love you
The reason is
Because I can't control myself
