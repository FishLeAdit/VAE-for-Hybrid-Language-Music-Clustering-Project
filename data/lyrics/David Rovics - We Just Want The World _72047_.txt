When we're living in the White House
And debating on the hill
Of all your crazy antics
We'll all have had our fill
We'll be closing down munitions plants
And Old Glory will be furled
'Cause we don't want your big machines
We just want the world
And a bill will be proposed
Section number one
We're shutting down the oil rigs
And turning towards the sun
The air will be clean
For all the boys and girls
'Cause we don't want your oil tankers
We just want the world
Face the executioner
Shut the logging camps all down
Get busy planting hemp
Leave the trees there in the ground
Life is too precious
On this little, spinning pearl
We don't want your bulldozers
We just want the world
We'll be closing down the jails
And fixing up the schools
Distributing those stocks and bonds
Changing all the rules
We'll elect a CEO
Maybe a rabbit or a squirrel
'Cause we don't want your money
We just want the world
We'll be swimming in the rivers
And running to the hills
Reading in the history books
Of wars and oil spills
If it's linear we'll bend it
If it's a straight line it'll curl
'Cause we don't want your dead-end highway
We just want the world
When we're living in the White House
And debating on the hill
Of all your crazy antics
We'll all have had our fill
We'll be closing down munitions plants
And Old Glory will be furled
'Cause we don't want your big machines
We just want the world
