Thought once I had a King;
Wore an invisible crown
Sometimes spoke truth
Mostly knew to say the wrong thing at the right time
Faithfully I played the clown
All the King’s horses
And all the King’s men
Could not put my heart
Back together again
Fall, fall away
Time heals, or so they bravely say
Well all this time I feel
Silence holds you real
Still I play the courtier
Your courtier in the wings
Chasing shadows
Clutching precious things
All your pretty horses
And all these men
No they won’t
Oh they can’t put my heart together again
Counting crows in the sky
Wondering if I
Could fall from great heights
If your wisdom was my pride
All the King’s horses
And all the King’s men
No they won’t
Oh they can't put my heart together again
All the King’s horses
And all the King’s men
Could not put my heart
Back together again
No they won’t, they can’t put my heart together again
