I'll be living in the now
Making everybody, everybody say wow
Never saying never I'm a show you how
Your divine so am I bl bl bl blaow
I put down my drink 'n
My third eye started blinkin
And then it got me thinkin
The booze got me sinkin
The smoke it had me twisted
Enough that I was listed
As alien and gifted
Evolution I assisted
I'll be living in the now
Making everybody, everybody say wow
Never saying never I'm a show you how
Your divine so am I bl bl bl blaow
Couldn't get enough and became a fiend
Now I'm off in a new galaxy
And got big plans and got big dreams
Get up in my spaceship and I'll show you what I mean
And I stop big scams and I still get cream
Miss Apocalypse I got a female team
My girls are tough and their never mean
Uniting everybody is Nakturnal's dream
Something that's bigger is talking to you
Something that's bigger through me it gets glue
To stick to your trigger my aura is blue
Throat chakra is pulsing I know what to do
Something that's bigger is talking to you
Something that's bigger through me it gets glue
To stick to your trigger my aura is blue
Throat chakra is pulsing I know what to do
I'll be living in the now
Making everybody, everybody say wow
Never saying never I'm a show you how
Your divine so am I bl bl bl blaow
Letting go of the sad girl, I do not mourn her
Integrating all my selves and I'm getting warmer
To the masses I will be celestial informer
Love me I am you're chameleon transformer
I'll be living in the now
Making everybody, everybody say wow
Never saying never I'm a show you how
Your divine so am I bl bl bl blaow
Couldn't get enough and became a fiend
Now I'm off in a new galaxy
And I got big plans and I got big dreams
Get up in my spaceship and I'll show you what I mean
And I stop big scams and I still get cream
Miss Apocalypse I got a female team
My girls are tough and their never mean
Uniting everybody is Nakturnal's dream
And my crew be unruly and my mind is clear
Now you can't fool me cause my spaceships here
I'll be gone in a flash say I love u dear
Yeah my man will rock bangin in your ear
Take it in and out, get up in my maze
I can feel your vibes, got me in a daze
And I hope this ain't, just a silly faze
Call me by the name say it Kellee Maize
I'll be living in the now
Making everybody, everybody say wow
Never saying never I'm a show you how
Your divine so am I bl bl bl blaow
