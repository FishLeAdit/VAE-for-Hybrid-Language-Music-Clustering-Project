I can't love you, no
And I did many times before
With all that's said in jest
Still my heart, it tears through my chest

I know you know
The love we had before could crumble mountains down


Words from edge to edge
Couldn't keep you from running through my head
Soft skin soaked in rain
The devil's jewels, they run through my veins

I know you know
The love we had before could crumble mountains down
