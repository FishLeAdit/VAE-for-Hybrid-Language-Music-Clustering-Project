If I just stay with you
The dark sky on the horizon
Will open wide and see
The future belongs to me
If I just stay with you
The whispers that were behind me
Will turn to cheers instead
And melt straight into my ears
If I just stay with you
If I just stay with you
If I just stay with you
If I just stay with you
The heartbeat that I am pumping
Will keep on loving you
Loving you all or nothing
If I just stay with you
The mountains that are before us
Will turn to stepping stones
Then brick by brick I am home
If I just stay with you
If I just stay with you
If I just stay with you
If I just stay with you
The dark sky on the horizon
Will open wide and see
The future belongs to me
If I just stay with you
If I just stay with you
If I just stay with you
(And blah, blah, blah)
