We've made up our minds and we've made up a mission
Got borders and freedoms and unknown conditions
I hope you don't, hope you don't, hope you don't, hope you -
I hope you don't, hope you don't, hope you don't mind
Blinders, car windows, or a life full of lust
What pressures of needing will generate luck?
It's not gambling, gambling, gambling, gambling
Gambling, gambling, gambling life away
What's special to you isn't special to everyone
Some things you love mean not much to another
Can't say any, say any, say any, say any
Say any, say any, anyone's wrong
I borrowed a friend's spine and it held me up
The things that you need will arise from the dark
Just like wishing wells, wishing wells, wishing wells, wishing wells
Wishing wells, wishing wells, wishing wells will
Omit your hopes when somebody you know feels lonely
Won't try controlling you, that part of myself that i flow through
That part of myself that i flow through
That part of myself that i flow through
But if we mix 'em right, like an apple pie
The flavours might just make us shine
Like a pretty bee, lost to the breeze
How it doesn't need to see
And if we free up time, we could spend it right
We could bend the light all the ways we'd like
Like a brand new child abandoned in the wild
Thinkin' we're so free
It's dinner time and we're all inside
It's first the rides and then the pie
I lead the seats and then the meat
Then we do the greet just as you leave
Thinkin' if we free up time, we could spend it right
We could bend the light all the ways we'd like
Like a brand new child abandoned in the wild
Thinkin' we're so free
Omit your hopes when somebody you know feels lonely
Won't try and control you, that part of myself that i flow through
Omit your hopes when somebody you know feels lonely
Won't try and control you, that part of myself that i flow through
That part of myself that i flow through
That part of myself that i flow through
(won't try and control you)
That part of myself that i flow through
