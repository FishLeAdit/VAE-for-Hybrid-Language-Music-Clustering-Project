Don't make me laugh
Don't make me groan
Don't make me wish that I was constantly alone
You get no cash, you get no fun
And still you act as if this is your second home
And I can't keep wasting my time
Trying to read your mind
If it's all part of your design
And part of your design
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I will always be suspicious of you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I will always be suspicious of you
And when you smile
It makes it worse
By now I've come to realize that we are cursed
Still I hold on
I don't know why
When every word you swear is true might be a lie
And I can't keep wasting my time
Trying to read your mind
If it's all part of your design
And part of your design
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I will always be suspicious of you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I will always be suspicious of you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I will always be suspicious of you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I will always be suspicious of you
I will always be suspicious
I will always be suspicious
