I’m the Venus for your Mars
I’m the healing for your scars
I’m the nighttime for your stars
You don’t have to look so far
Watering the family tree
Ever after happily
If the Earth falls to the sea
In your arms is where I’ll be

We already are
You and me
Psychically in tune to the, stars

Sometimes we fight like cats and dogs
But here we are giving it our all
So many years in the making, but then forsaking, and forgetting
Even for a moment, I am not betting on our demise
I can see the future in your eyes
I see the presence, ironic surprise
When you go counter and I clockwise
Thru the world’s pain and all the lies
We will grow a garden every time
And if I harden, will you remind
Me of the softness, I had in my prime
If I seek will you help me find, and when I freak won’t you be kind
Know there's sometimes demons in the mind
What can I say, it's hard being an interdimensional bride

I’m the Venus your Mars
I’m the healing for your scars
I’m the nighttime for your stars
You don’t have to look so far
Watering the family tree
Ever after happily
If the Earth falls to the sea
In your arms is where I’ll be

We already are
You and me
Psychically in tune to the, stars

You might as well get used to this
Death do us part, here healthy or sick
I got eternity to wait
And I know I’m choosing my own fate
And Even if I was, burned at the stake
I would reincarnate
Like a yogi in a lotus
From the mud we are exploded
I didn’t walk to you, I floated
When empty, you help me get reloaded

I’m the Venus your Mars
I’m the healing for your scars
I’m the nighttime for your stars
You don’t have to look so far
Watering the family tree
Ever after happily
If the Earth falls to the sea
In your arms is where I’ll be

We already are
You and me
Psychically in tune to the, stars
