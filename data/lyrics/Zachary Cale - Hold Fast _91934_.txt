If I let you stand inside of me
Could you learn to walk, could you learn to breathe?
Or would you shield your eyes from the ugly things that bare their teeth and beat their wings?
Hold fast to the ray, that slips past the falling rain. Keep your dream ’neath your hat, and the wind on your back
Day breaks, cock crows, earth quakes, night glows
Flowers wilt, love dies, snow melts, sun shines. Oh my, oh my
Well the past is still the past you can visit anytime
Nothing’s really changed except a few road signs
Well it’s quiet ’round here and we like it that way. So don’t go sniffing ’round a newly dug grave
Hold fast to the ray, that slips past the falling rain. Keep your dream ’neath your hat, and the wind on your back
Day breaks, cock crows, earth quakes, night glows
Flowers wilt, love dies, snow melts, sun shines. Oh my, oh my
