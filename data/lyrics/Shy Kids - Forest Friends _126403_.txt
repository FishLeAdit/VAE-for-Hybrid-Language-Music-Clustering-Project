Is it my place to carve my name in someone else's tree?
To try and trim my neighbour's limbs when I don't like the leaves?
Cuz the fruit nature makes,
won't always taste the same in two different kitchens!
Is it my way to speak my mind, and argue when you're wrong?
An off-note slides, it keeps inside, so we can sing along.
And I know how you feel...
And I'm sorry that we deal a little bit different.
Yeah we function as brothers would,
having our fits and holding contempt for each other.
Be careful as I plod beneath this canopy of boughs and leaves,
cuz these forest friends were hard to find
if I only brave the woods at night!
We'll never fuck up as brothers,
We'll sometimes fuck up as friends.
Is it so bad to want a space where I can be my own?!
A groove where I can hide away, my forest friends may never know
How my hymns twist and bend...
But I love that we can spend an evening singing!
Is it so bad to want a place where I can slow it down?
A half-time beat protecting me from voices pirouetting 'round.
And I don't mean to hurt...
And I'd like to learn to be a bit better!
Yeah we function as brothers would,
holding a place and saving a tune for each other.
Speak lightly as I plod beneath this canopy of yelps and screams,
cuz these forest friends were hard to find
if I only brave the woods at night.
