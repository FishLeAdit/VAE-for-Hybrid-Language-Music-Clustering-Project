It's the place
Where the small houses
Lean on each other
Small, small wooden houses
Facing the islands
And the sea
And the sea
It's the place
Where the seagulls circle
Hoping to catch some fish
From the sea
In the harbor
Rusty fishing boats
Coming in
From the East
From the East

Thats the place where we grew up
Thats the place where we grew up
Thats the place where we grew up
Thats the place where we grew up
On a day when the sun is shining
The most beautiful place to be
Silent waves turn to gold
But it's not the place to be
Anymore
But it walks
Good day and good night
See the X against the sky
Been there for hundreds of years
No one remember why
Remember why

Thats the place where we grew up
Thats the place where we grew up
Thats the place where we grew up
Thats the place where we grew up
It's the place
Where the small houses
Lean on each other
Small, small, wooden houses
Facing the islands
And the sea
And the sea

Thats the place where we grew up
Thats the place where we grew up
Thats the place where we grew up
Thats the place where we grew up
