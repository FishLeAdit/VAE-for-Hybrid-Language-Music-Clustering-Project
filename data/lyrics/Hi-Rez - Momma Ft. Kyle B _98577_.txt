I wanna tell you 'bout this lady
Man she really is the greatest
No debatin' working late just to fix all her sons a plate
You gon' leave that 9 to 5 a lot sooner than you think
I'mma take you on vacation name a place we'll take the plane
My life just wouldn't be the same
Without you in it, not at all
You picked me up when i fall
You  always answer my calls
You helped me through situation no matter how big or small
When my back's against the wall you violency through it all
When i was sick you always knew just exactly what to do
Moved out the Bronx just to put all your sons in a better school
I know i act like a fool and for that I'm sorry ma'am
But thanks for giving me chances and being my first fan
Mom, i'll always hold your hand no matter what age i am
Cause you're my mom, you're my hero, you're my motherfucking fam
And that's forever

Let me tell you bout' a friend of mine
From the beginning to the end of time
And we hadn’t a lot of money
But the days were always sunny
And everything always turned out, fine
That’s my momma, that’s my momma, yeah
That’s my momma, that’s my momma, hey
I couldn’t ask for no one better
I’ll be there for ever, cause you’re my momma

??? music and you supported my decisions
You always there just to listen and you gave my ass kicking
When I needed it, all my dreams you believed it
When I needed advice you always gave me a piece of it
You taught me how to ride a bike
Taught me what was wrong and right
Supported when i bought a mic
Waited through the longest lies
To make sure i got home, came out to my first show
Always served my own dose still you take out your purse though
Even though the times were hard it's all good now
Invited all my friends to the house for a cook out
Heaven better look out for this angel when the time come
Ma' you raised some fine sons and you gave ‘em all love
You came out to my graduations
Even though i barely made it
Plus on top of that you was taking care of all you patients
Thanks for always being patient

Let me tell you bout' a friend of mine
