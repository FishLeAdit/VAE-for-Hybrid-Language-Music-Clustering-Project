Mr. John Lee, what is happening to me?
Last time I saw you bringing firewood into your house from a tree
But I didn't love you quite as much as sweet Marie
Sheriff, he never had to come
To wade through the water swamps
And some strange mystery to find Marie
Me clad in Velveteen, red lips, and high-heeled shoes
I carried you, your weight for a long time
Through years and towns and took refuge
And I carried your weight upon mine
Marie got married to a man
And I found your footsteps in summer lands to your lady
Marie has a daughter and a new city now
And your skin is soft and tired from the years
You're happy now
Me clad in Velveteen, red lips, and high-heeled shoes
I carried you, your weight for a long time
Through years and towns and took refuge
And I carried your weight upon mine
