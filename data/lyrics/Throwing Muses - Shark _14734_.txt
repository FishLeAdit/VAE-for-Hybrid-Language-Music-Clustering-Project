This afternoon
Your back's not so straight
Your eyes aren't too clear
I could kiss you for remembering my birthday
Find you on the dock
Out of money, out of luck
You should thank me for remembering your name
You could be very easy
Spin the shot glass
Kiss the bottle
Shark in your brain
Spin the shot glass
Kill the bottle
Shark in your brain
'Cause she's warm
'Cause she's warm
'Cause she's warm
This afternoon
Your bite's not so bad
Your bark's not too scary
I could kiss you for remembering my address
Find you in the dumps
Out of money, out of drugs
You should thank me for offering my mattress
You could be very easy
Spin the shot glass
Kiss the bottle
Shark in your brain
Spin the shot glass
Kill the bottle
Shark in your brain
'Cause she's warm
'Cause she's warm
'Cause she's warm
Spin the shot glass
Shoot the bottle
I find angels over drinks
And you're one
And you're one
And you're one
