Chorus
It could be you
It could be me
It could be everything we see
Given the day, given the time, given the moment
Some of it comes
Consequence flows
Keep your legs on
Iron bound, turn to spurn
Could you be, in a world
But not of any world
Could you stand in the center
Of a space and beware
Chorus
Some of it comes
Consequence flows
Keep your legs on
Iron bound, turn to spurn
Could you be
Anything, anywhere
Up above
Down below
Would you stand
Would you think on the zone?
And the morning could be yours
And the dog could be ours
And the night we could give it away
Chorus
