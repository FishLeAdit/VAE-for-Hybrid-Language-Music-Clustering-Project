Grace fully falling down
Like a river
Like the water
Run running on
Moving the mountainside
You are stronger
You can shape it
And as you gave
To the fire
To the fire
So be made
Steam and ember
Into spires
Circle of stones, boulders broken
So you can hold them
So you can hold all these
Bones of old, stories spoken
So you can be them
So we can breathe
In like a wave
Out like a sighing
Catch it on a whim
Deepen to your longing
Trench of tears, offered open
So you can give them
So you can give to the
Ocean old, moving moment
So we can hear them
So we can hear all these
Aching songs, ancient swimmers
Keepers of balance
Givers of sound
Time begins, still they are weaving
So we can find them
So we be found
Circle of stones, boulders broken
So you can hold them
So you can hold
Bones of old, stories spoken
So you can see them
So we can breathe
Grace fully falling down like a river
Like the water, run running on
Moving the mountainside
You are stronger, you can shape it
