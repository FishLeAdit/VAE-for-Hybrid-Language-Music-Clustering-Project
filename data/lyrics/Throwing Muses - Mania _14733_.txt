What means hallucinate?
What are we supposed to see?
What are they supposed to want?
Get a job!
You scare me
I sing here
I'm alone here
I'm with you over here
Marshmallow brain
I need an umbrella
If I'm gonna stand in the rain
My hands are cupped and full of blood and eyes is spirals
I am on my knees and praying
That is how I pray cause that is how you pray
Rat rat rat rat rat rat, huh!
Tongue thickens, I am with those who eat drugs
Who peek over the wall and get shocked
Shocking is therapy
Electrify your head!
Pianos in my hearing
Vincent, my ear is falling off
Who left me alone?
What do you mean you're alone?
Goddamn wolves
No one has that dream
Hallucinate
I need an umbrella
If I'm gonna go insane
I think she wanna be crazy, pick a brain!
I think I'm running away
Oh boy, God?
I'm gonna scare that boy again? Not again
Centerdale to Providence
Middletown to Armageddon
A road is in my dream
Centerdale is in my dream
Drums!
Carry me over the wall
You! left me alone
What do you mean you're alone?
I peek over the wall and get sick
Sickness is therapy
Electrify your head!
Catalyst
I need an umbrella
If I'm gonna slit my wrist
Pick your hands up
Put them on your head
Move it around and say
This is too much
It doesn't fit
Your feet say nothing but move your hips
Move your hips
Move your hips
Rat rat rat rat rat rat
Mania, oh!
