Baby bones, are you cold?
Gather up your scattered toes
And I will hold them close
Baby bones, are you cold?
Are you cold baby bones?
A clattering of tones is
Throwing me off some
And often you're lonesome
'Cause as awful as it is
We all have forgotten not to forget
Anything about the way you say it
Anything about the way you play it
Anything about the way you say it
You say it so hollow, hello
