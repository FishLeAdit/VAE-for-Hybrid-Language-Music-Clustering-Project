A new-found flu in animals we never knew were so ill
A politician's finger's itchin' to press the button
To press the big red button
Opening windows is closing my doors
Stopped for directions, then dissected
Wanna get home on time, and they wanna see my insides
I left for work to forward jokes, never thinking bout airplanes
Never once thinking bout airplanes
Send this to ten friends and you'll be fine
One more clove to keep out the vampires
The inbox is empty, i'm sick of waiting around for this message
Another flash on the screen, another pinch from the dream
A reminder to just keep living
Hey plug, don't wait, your juice is draining
There's no outlet for you remaining
Sick with a virus, and the bug has got me pious
I feel it all shutting down, so i look to the clouds
Maybe they'll remember who i was
Hey plug, don't wait, your juice is draining
There's no outlet for you remaining
I'm slamming on the keys
Finding out about diseases
I never knew that i had
Minimizing all my lives
When the screens have turned to blinds to the
Tab
Tab
Tab
Tab
Tab, i can't pay, pay it back, i said!
>> this moment you are in is the oldest you have been. you'll always feel your age if you're waiting for the end. never mind it, it'll find you, so just keep go go going
