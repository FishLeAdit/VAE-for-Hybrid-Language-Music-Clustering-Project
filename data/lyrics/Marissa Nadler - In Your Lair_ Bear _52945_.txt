Where did you go when the snow fell that year?
You were inside these wooden walls like a bear
Eager child for the end in your lair
For the end of the year
And that old familiar fear creeps up your little arms
And runs through your veins
Like blood through your songs
Like blood through your songs
Like blood through your songs
Then summer came and he wore you like a charm
And you knew yourself, that what had come would soon be gone
Well sometimes in your burrowed hole
You love to be the pawn always moving on
Oh where did I go when the rains fell that year?
We were inside that wooden house like a bear
Eager child for the end to be near
For the end of the year
And then winter came and I wore him like a charm
And we knew that what had come would soon be gone
Well sometimes in my burrowed hole
I feel it coming on, always moving on
An island is always alone
And you were breaking yours with a stone
So I took you home to a bastion
A hurricane by any other name
So I took you home and I crashed you
A hurricane in your veins
