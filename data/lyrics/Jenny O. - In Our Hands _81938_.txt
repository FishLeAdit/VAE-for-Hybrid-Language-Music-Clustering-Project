This is the year that you dream about
When it all comes out
And we are done
Picture the faces in a roundabout
Can you take it?
Oh no no no
It's in our hands
We make our own plans
You fall now
Face it, I will too
It's up to you to make it happen
To see it through
Just bow your head and I will too
We traveled
Starry-eyed
Up to the edge
And then you turned
And left me there for dead
And later
When I won you over again
Oh I burned you back in the end
It's in our hands
We make our own plans
You fall now
Maybe I will too
It's up to you to make it happen
To see it through
Just bow your head and I will too
Oh I'll keep a candle lit for you!
So it is written
You were good to me
And to your family
Who will I be?
And should we ever get it back again
Can we make it up here, my friend?
It's in our hands
If this is goodbye
You go your way and I will too
It's up to you
To say I'm sorry
And then I love you
Just bow your head little darling
Come on, your girl is calling
Just bow your head and I will too
