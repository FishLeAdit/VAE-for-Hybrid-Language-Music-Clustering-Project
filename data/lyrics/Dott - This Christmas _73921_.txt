Hey
Uh, hmm
Hmm, hmm
Oh-oh-oh

Remember last December
When we kissed under the mistletoe, oh, oh
I let you wear my favorite sweater
So you think of me when you're alone, yeah
When we stay up talking way too much
And we don't even need coffee to keep us up, no
Yeah, I know that I'm feeling something
Right when I'm next to you, oh

(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
It's cold outside when I'm without you
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
But you make me feel so warm

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
Baby, can't you see
Can't you see that I want you? (Ooh, ooh, yeah)
Yeah, I just wanna be with you this Christmas

Mmm-mmhm...
Mmm-mmm-mmh
This Christmas
Mmm-mmhm...
Mmm-mmm-mmh
This Christmas

And to be honest, I can't live without you (No)
Just ask my friends, they say I'm so about you
Buy you anything you want (Hey), Gucci and Saint Laurent (Yeah)
Girl, you know what I'm up, I'm just saying
Santa gon' be leaving at 5 AM
Baby, I can pull up, it don't matter what time it is
Yeah, I know, it's Christmas Eve
But, girl, you're all I need
I'll be there in one, two, three
Yeah, anything if I can get to you

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
Baby, can't you see
Can't you see that I want you? (Ooh, ooh, yeah)
Yeah, I just wanna be with you this Christmas

Mmm-mmhm... (Ooh)
Mmm-mmm-mmh
This Christmas
Mmm-mmhm... (Oh oh-woah)
Mmm-mmm-mmh
This Christmas

Yeah yeah
Mmm-mmm-mmh
This Christmas
Mmm-mmhm...
Mmm-mmm-mmh
