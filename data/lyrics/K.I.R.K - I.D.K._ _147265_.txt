I've been looking in the mirror, I don't know myself
I've been feeling kinda down, yeah I need help
I don't know what to do, baby is this hell?
My anxiety so high, baby can you tell?
I know how it feels to be alone
I know how it feels to not be at home
I know how it feels to be alone

I know that I'm bad for you
I know that your heart split in two
I know mine belongs to you, to you
Ooh, I don't what to feel anymore
I don't know what to say anymore
All I know is that you're my bae
I just hope I'm not too late
I just hope you feel the same way about me
I was so sad when you told me you were 
All I could say is that is that I'm sorry
All I could say is that is that I'm sorry

Love me
Love me now, love me now, yeah love me
Love me now, love me now, yeah love me
Love me now, love me now, yeah
Yeah, love me now, love me now, yeah

I've been looking in the mirror, I don't know myself
I've been feeling kinda down, yeah I need help
I don't know what to do, baby is this hell?
My anxiety so high, baby can you tell?
I know how it feels to be alone
I know how it feels to not be at home
I know how it feels to be alone

Now I'm walking down my own path
Looking on my right and left
'Cause I will never give you what I have left
Hey, I got weed on me, I got pills on me
I'ma take 'em all but I won't take nobody with me
Perkies in my system, hoping they will kill me
Just because I know I will never see your face again
And you used to hate my friends
All they was telling me is that you gon' break me again
Never believed them I thought you were gon' be the one
Yeah, never believed them
Now looking at you, done

Man, having a girlfriend is hard
No! Being crazy is hard
You're getting all hung up, all hung up on imaginary problems
You gotta focus on what's real, man
