(Verse 1)
I cannot escape the shame
To face what we have done
And you can try to say
That we were young
But it was real for us
(Pre-Chorus)
I thought I found the world
But all I got was cursed
Cause I'd Jump in the ocean
For all your devotion
I still fight the voice in my soul, Run
Run run run fool run
(Chorus)
Cause I'd be a fool
For you for you
(Repeat)
(Verse 2)
And I never thought I’d say this, But
I regret the day we made love
Cause that's when I started praying to God
That I retain my sanity
can't believe she brought me to my knees
Try to work it out work it work it out
That's what they talkin bout talkin bout talkin bout
I thought I found the world
But all I got was cursed
Cause i'd Jump in the ocean
For all your devotion
I still fight the voice in my soul, Run
Run run run fool run
Cause I'd be a fool
For you for you
(Repeat)
