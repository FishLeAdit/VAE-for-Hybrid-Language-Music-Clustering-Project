You keep playing names now
And you keep playing your games on
And you keep playing your tricks on me
And all i ever wanted
All i ever wanted was your loving
You keep bringing your friends to
And you keep bringing your men to
You keep bringing your.... to me
And when all i ever wanted
All i ever wanted was your loving
All i ever wanted was your loving
All i ever wanted was to love....
You keep playing names on me
And you keep playing your games on me
And you keep playing your tricks on me
And all i ever wanted
All i ever wanted was your loving
