I must admit
That I only skim through
Your poetry and
Our last kiss
Tasted of alcohol
The only thing that I could focus on

I see oceans now between us
Distance closer now

And I'll fall asleep
Alone under the sheets
No slow, sleepy breathing
And no heart beating
Next to me

I see oceans now between us
Distance closer now
