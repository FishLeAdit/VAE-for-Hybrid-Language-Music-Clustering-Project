I got no respect for homies trying to hit you up
Just trying to figure out whether or not you are a slut
Or whether or not you'll let 'em fuck and the next day let 'em duck
Cause if you real i gotta stop, y'all let me quickly interupt
But real talk, these fools they trying to bust a nut
Break a heart, create a slut, break you off and then break up
They ain't trying to be friendly when they smoking you out on blunts
Cause the shit these fools are doing is shit i already done
Smoking with a girl for pussy and i done it more than once
All the guys you with in classroom
I'm touring on a bus, getting high, ignoring sluts
Cause sluts are boring as fuck
And at the end of the day, girl you the only one i trust
You the only one i love, you the only one i need
You my ecstasy, my alcohol, most importantly weed
What's most important to me is you never lose faith
And you hit me up first cause cell phones work two ways
And i bet you roommates say i overstay my welcome
But tell 'em you got my back and i got yours and that's forever
That's something that just won't change, i'll take your troubles away
Regardless if we together or we in a different place, that's for real

I'm sick of taking these pills
I'm sick of dating these girls
Matter of fact I'm just about sick with the fucking world
I'm sick of the late night calls
I'm sick of the morning texts
I'm sick of this broken record
And I'm even sick with the sex

Somebody once told me that love is urban legend
My heart's infested with love, but love just leads to aggresion
Which only leads to depression, that shit just leads to pain
Feelings is just like seasons and you know that seasons change
In my heart there's demons caged and they're begging to get loose
They're begging to hear the truth, I'm tempted to bend the rules
Everybody plays a fool in this silly game of love
That's why i get faded cause i just wanna be above
The influence of your lies
And they're hitting my brain like drugs
Kisses and hugs are deadly, they get me higher than bud
Your love is stuck in my blood and i'll be with it 'till i die
It's what fucking takes me high, it's what's always on my mind
It's the reason that I'm stressing, the reason i love my life
I know it's hella confusing i think I'm loving a lie
I wake up rubbing my eyes and question if love is real
Is it really an illusion or something i'll one day feel
I'm a hamster in a wheel, running round in fucking circles
I need to get back on track like a person running hurdles
I'm a turtle in this game but I'm patient so I'm waiting
Until then you can probably find me somewhere getting faded
Quit the hating

I'm sick of taking these pills
I'm sick of dating these girls
Matter of fact I'm just about sick with the fucking world
I'm sick of the late night calls
I'm sick of the morning texts
I'm sick of this broken record
And I'm even sick with the sex
