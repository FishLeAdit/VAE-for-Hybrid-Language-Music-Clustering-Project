The words don't come out right
I say them every night 
I put them in the light
Come back tomorrow 
If what You say is true
There's nothing I can do
But give myself to You
All of my sorrow
For black sheep, dark horses, and underdogs
What is all I say
It's how I spend the day
Make it go away
Take me, I'm hollow
Change is what's in store
Ever giving more
Reaching through the door
Lovely but shallow
For black sheep, dark horses, and underdogs
We’re singing this
For black sheep, dark horses, and underdogs
How blessed are the feet
That bring good tidings
Like the joy
(that) skips over the hills
When finally we meet
'mongst curious findings
Say the word
He came to set the captives free
