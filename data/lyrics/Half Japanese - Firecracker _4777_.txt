Oh no, she held his hand and they clutched their love
Oh my, they made a wish on the stars up above
Oh me, I guess that leaves me out in the cold
Or so, so, so, so I been told
Oh why, why won't she listen to me?
Oh gee, I know that she would come back at me
Oh sure we'd have a love, to have and to hold
Or so, so, so, so I been told
Firecracker, firecracker, boom boom boom
Firecracker, firecracker, boom boom boom
Boys got the muscles, teachers got the brains
Girls got the sexy legs, they win the game
Muscles ain't strong, brains ain't smart
But oh, those legs, they won my heart
Oh no, it's not bad, it's just wrong
Oh yeah, and I know it won't be long
A boy gets two loves worth more than gold
Or so, so, so, so I been told
Because true love is worth more than a king's gold
Or so I been told
