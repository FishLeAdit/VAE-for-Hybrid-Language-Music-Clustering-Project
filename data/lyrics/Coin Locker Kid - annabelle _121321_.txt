Certainly
There's a Mercury
A mockery...
What's it called?
I was there
Put your windows down
It's the light that makes me wander
Far
Away from you tonight
Tonight
--
And dogs will eat every broken bone
And I will walk through every open doorway
--
Suddenly...
There's a mystery!
Your skin is porcelain
Take a rest. Yeah
Touch yourself
Take your panties off
It's the cum that makes you smile
When
I fuck you on the floor
The doormat
It's the cum that makes you wonder
Makes you pull
Me back under
Your control
It's something that we should have realized
Long ago
A goal
The bell will not toll
I crawl inside your skull
But balance on your tongue
And die between your legs
To suck upon your eggs
And dogs will eat through every broken bone
And
I will walk
Through
Every
Open
Doorway
