When I woke up in the city I was puffin' on a mighty bone
And the day was lookin' pretty and I wondered where I wanted to go
Downtown seemed old
Hat a trip into the woods
No fuck that
You know what would be really neat
Is a day at the beach
I was gettin' kinda giddy and I really couldn't wait to go
I picked up a couple biddys with some towels and a bag full of blow
Lets get a bottle and we'll put it back
We'll sleep out in the sand in our knapsacks
In the morning yeah I wanna see
Another day at the beach
When I woke up feeling shitty I was movin' just a little bit slow
But my hand was on some titties and my song was on the radio
Buried in thе sand I found a dime and rolled another bonе
And when I got high I thought about going home
Jumped in the water like I was a kid
Then this girl gave me a hit of acid
I'm trippin' out and I didn't plan it
The sound of the wavesmakes me fuckin' panic
Sittin' pretty bout half past noon
I was high as a kite in the sand dunes
Take me back to the city
No! I wanna stay at the beach
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
I wanna stay at the beach
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
I wanna stay at the beach
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
I wanna stay at the beach
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
I wanna stay at the beach
