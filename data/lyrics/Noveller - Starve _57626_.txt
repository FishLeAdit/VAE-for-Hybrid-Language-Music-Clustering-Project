You touched me in the heart
You saw the ghost I had become
Even now it's not the same
The jester laughs, the king holds his head in shame
Because you’re the one to blame
Because you're the one to blame
Because you're the one to
Grandmother’s cellar is locked at night
Won't you get the whiskey she keeps at night?
If you do this for me, I won't tell those strangers about you
You'll be safe for the rest of your life
You're going to starve
You're going to starve
You're going to starve
This young man came to me and said he wanted done
It's over, now he’s gone
It’s over
It's over
It’s over
It's over
It's over...
