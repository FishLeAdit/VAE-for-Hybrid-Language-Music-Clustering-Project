I am deep at sea
I made myself break free
Of the anchor keeping me
Safe and sound in sanity
Safe inside my old routine
I am far from land
I have left in my hand
A few grains of sand
And I try to understand
The world in all its expanse
Alone again, I hope to find
A greater kindness, peace of mind
A faith, a joy in my core
I leave my love on familiar shores
I am deep at sea
The waves roll over me
Tossed among eternity
I am as much as everything
I am good for nothing
Alone again, I hope to find
A greater kindness, peace of mind
A faith, a joy in my core
I head for some unknown shore
I am deep at sea
I am swimming. I am free
A great love envelops me
I feel a part of something
This life, it is for living
The truth is growing stronger
My youth is getting farther
I am deep at sea
