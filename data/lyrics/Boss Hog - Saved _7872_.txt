All this time I'm still holding it down (Down, down down)
A broken soul, I can't figure it out (Out, out, out)

In the night, when it calls
I feel it now, wanna feel it now
Like a fire in my soul
All I hope, can you save me from myself?

Myself, myself
Can you save me from myself?
Myself, myself
Can you save me from myself?


Is this a dream or a nightmare I chose?
In my heart, feel it deep in my bones

In the night, when it calls
I feel it now, wanna feel it now
Like a fire in my soul
All I hope, can you save me from myself?

Myself, myself
Can you save me from myself?
Myself, myself
Can you save me from myself?

Myself, myself
Can you save me from myself?
Myself, myself
Can you save me from myself?
