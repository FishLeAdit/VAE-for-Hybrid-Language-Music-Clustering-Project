I saw you bathing in the river
I saw you throwing off the water from your beautiful wings
I want to live a life of brightness and purity
Beautiful like you
Envy, desire
Waiting on the wire
Till the other birds are gone
Wade in the springs
To bleach those dirty wings
The raven and the swan
The raven and the swan
I was a circle in the water
Spreading out along the edges, and breaking up on the shore
A little bit of time and I'm beautiful
I'm beautiful like you
