All I want is brick house with a porch that wraps around
All I want is land enough for my children to run
In the highest pitch of grace
The end of trial and gratitude
It was for you that all others I did forsake
For you all others I would forsake
How could it have been so often
That we did speak of purpose and of having
Dreamt his body with his back to the lake
Certain depths I cannot place
Walk and talk fine through all of the days
But still I'd miss the words you’d say
Past the point now of trusting that to change
I've just learned to live around it
And still, I will sleep too long or I will hardly rest at all
So from where does energy come?
Meet me by the fire door
Of happiness, I don’t ask more
She is who I cut root vegetables beside
With you present in my mind
And it is with them that we spend our nights
Laughter that tides us through the rest
I liked it best when the morning had not left
And wake was not yet in your eyes
High, high, high, low, low, low
I would have seen you through both
