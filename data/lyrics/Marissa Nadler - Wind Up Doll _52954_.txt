Wind her up, wind her up
It's been years since she came
Over on the green plains to you
She calls his name
Sha-na-dee a dee a dee a dee
Over rock and sea to her baby
When the box went in the ground
Cedar trees were all around
A war did take him from her town
And she ain't nothing but a ghost now
Wind-up doll in the back
Wind-up doll click and clack
Click and clack
She will never be what you want her to be
She has dreams every night
That the box of cedar where
Where you went to lay will come to life
Hold her on the greens
Hold her on the green plains like you used to do
But she ain't nothing but a ghost you
You wind her up in the back
Wind-up doll click and clack
Click and clack
She will never be what you want her to be
Wind her up to walk and wind her up to speak
Hold her on the greens
Hold her on the green plains like you used to do
But she ain't nothing but a ghost
