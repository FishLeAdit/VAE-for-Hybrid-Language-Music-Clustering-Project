Yesterday is not today, ill let the memories fade away
I gotta keep keep moving on, i had the power all along
I know that i might seem naive
But look deep and you'll see my tree
I've been learning every day
Been working hard with little play
Oh thanks for all the negativity
See thats why i don't watch tv
Yesterday is not today, ill let the memories fade away
I gotta keep keep moving on, i had the power all along
The start die before we see
I was that before i was me
Im pulsing lonely in my field of gray
Digital bearings program my day
Unfold my mirrors and see on thru
Discuss it all in terms of you
Bleeding hands reveal my love
I am seeking all the meaning from above
Yesterday is not today, ill let the memories fade away
I gotta keep keep moving on, i had the power all along
I think that i can find a light
Fuck the weak folks who won't fight
We gotta stand up and take whats ours
Show the youth how to reach for the stars
Ill take my space ship strait to mars
And you can chill in those corporate bars
But i would love some company
So hows about you joining me
In fact you can steer baby
And bring the others and we will all be free
Cause if im secluded
Then your alone
Im slowely torn from my thrown
Wasted visions of purity
Salvation isn't found in the majority
Collect my values in my purse
I bore my soul with each new verse
