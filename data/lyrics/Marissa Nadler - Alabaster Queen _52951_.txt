When you came to town, I fell for you, it seems
To a house with twisted branches and a candle dream
I'll be your Alabaster Queen
Your Alabaster Queen
When I hear you play, I think of water and sunshine
And I'll never really mind all your women
Wistful wanting you all the time
I'll be your Alabaster Queen
Your Alabaster Queen
Your Alabaster Queen
And Sunshine King
