Spent almost half the night
At the construction site
Smiling mysteriously
The weather keeps changing
The world keeps deranging me
Is this the way it should be?
And all i can do
Is to stand next to you
With a frown and a lopsided grin
This is the city
And this is the body
And this is the mess that I'm in
We sway and we falter
We constantly alter
Turn over and over
And over and over again
We walk and we stumble
We constantly fumble
For words to obscure and for words to explain
Cast the yellowed postcards away
Leave the house at least once a day
Don't let the monsters lead you astray
And leave the house at least once a day
Be the weather dark as it may:
Leave the house at least once a day
Don't let the monsters lead you astray
Leave the house at least once a day
