Nothing to lose
I like to my play my own game, game, game
My own game, game, game
Ain't got no rules
I like to my play my own game, game, game
My own game, game, game
I bet they don't know how to turn you on
Just follow me, I'll show you how it's done
Nothing to lose
I like to my play my own game, game, game
My own game, game, game

My own game, game, game
My own game, game, game
My own game, game, game
My own game, game, game
Nothing to lose
I like to my play my own game, game, game
My own game, game, game
Nothing to lose, lose, lose...
One, two, three, whoop!


Nothing to lose
I like to my play my own game, game, game
My own game, game, game
Ain't got no rules
I like to my play my own game, game, game
My own game, game, game
I bet they don't know how to turn you on
Just follow me, I'll show you how it's done

Nothing to lose
I like to my play my own game, game, game
My own game, game
Nothing to lose
I like to my play my own game, game, game
My own game, game, game
Nothing to lo, lo, lo, lo...
