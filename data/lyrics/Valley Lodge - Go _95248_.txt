My heart, my soul, I'm begging you for more
I’m on my knees, baby please, can I drink from your loving cup?
I’m too scared to say that I love you
But I know I gotta see you tonight
Odori ga sugoku umai des ne baby
Oh koko o sa wa te, oh come on pretty lady
Odori ga sugoku umai des ne baby
Do you got a little love in your heart heart heart heart

Go, tell me what I want to hear, tell me that I'm beautiful
Tell me that all again, 'cuz I remember grey skies too

I know it’s only rock n roll
But everything you do and where you are I’ll go
Oh did you see me waiting there out on the corner did I push it just a little too far ?
Odori ga sugoku umai des ne baby
Oh koko o sa wa te, oh can I get a maybe
Odori ga sugoku umai des ne baby
I’m gonna take you out for dinner and breakfast come on now!

Go, tell me what I want to hear, tell me that I'm beautiful
Tell me that all again, 'cuz I remember grey skies too

Tell me what I want to hear, and i’ll tell you that you’re beautiful
Tell me that all again, do you remember laughter too?


Take me to the bridge we’ll leave without a sound
Take me to your house when no one is around
We’ll meet outside of Ginza girl if you got it in ya
I can’t wait til the sun goes down down

Go, tell me what I want to hear, tell me that I’m beautiful
Turn it all on again, 'cuz I remember grey skies too

Go, tell me what I want to hear, and I’ll tell you that you’re beautiful
Tell me that all again, do you remember laughter too?

Tell me what I want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear
