I thought I saw you standing over on the corner in dream
You were looking right through me
I thought I knew where I was

Before you came into my life, I was in over my head

Giving it up, giving it up
It's on my mind
Giving it up
There's nowhere left to hide
Giving it up, giving it up
It's on my guide
Giving it up
I'll give it one more shot

When I was young, I thought the world would never know my shame
I thought the loneliness was gain
Scattered pictures on my wall
I wish you were easier, easier, easier, every now and then
Something's gotta give, I thought I knew who I was

Before you came into my life, I was in over my head

Giving it up, giving it up
It's on my mind
Giving it up
There's nowhere left to hide
Giving it up, giving it up
It's on my guide
Giving it up
I'll give it one more shot

Giving it up, giving it up
It's on my mind
Giving it up
There's nowhere left to hide
Giving it up, giving it up
It's on my guide
Giving it up
I'll give it one more shot
