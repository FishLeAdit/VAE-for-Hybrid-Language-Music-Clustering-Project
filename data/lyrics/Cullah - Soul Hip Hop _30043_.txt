Like me or not, I didn't come up here to be liked
I came up here to get paid
And whoever you put in front of me
I'm gonna chop you down
I'd like to send a special shoutout
To my homeboy, O.J Simpson
Keep up the good work, baby
Two less we gotta worry about, you understand
Keep up the good work

Sucka niggas had me itchin to cause a riot
Shit it's been a while since I put all the force in a punch so
It go thru' a nigga chest, never could be quiet
Heard they went in reverse when we
Wеnt thru' the trenches of hеllfire
Was the only nigga that was
Standin' around on the block like a fuckin' diversity hire
Leader a liar, they griftin for dollars
And doin' Masterclass seminars
How the fuck is you talkin' bout organization
But ya demographic is nothin' but niggas
That suck on a dick of a academic?
Flaunt the vocabulary
Patronizin' the folks that survive
Off the strength of the block
I wonder if all those degrees will protect you
When niggas start sendin' them shots
Then you start cryin' on Twitter when shit hit the fan
And we all just pretend to be shocked
What do you mean that
Because of your color of skin that
They didn't reserve you a spot
Funny you was sayin' niggas lacked rebel potential
The kettle be callin' the pot
Switch ya stance, no Master Raven
When you in them courts and
They start tamperin' with ya affidavit
All of that schoolin' ain't prep for today
Same time know a trap nigga that
Be beatin' the case like he TSA
Insurrection, uh, comin' from that bottom up
With a lotta ignorant niggas totin' a lotta guns

And I got the team
I got the come- they stronger than linebackers


Get your hand out of my pocket!
When I'm gone see you again?
 (Sock it to me one more time)

Nigga, get with the program
It be me you see on the slam cam
Posterize a nigga now his bitch wanna jam
I'm a God fearin' man till I get her in that bedroom
Taught her some new tricks and
Now she stuck with me like tattoos
We the demographic that be movin' with the violence
LV be the belt but it shine like Orion
Glocky got a twin
I can't wait for you to meet her
You not tryna see em together like unified Korea
No Tisa but my Visa be Korean, no really
The way I blow this paper they be thinkin' that I'm silly
I done spoiled my girl, she more bougie than BLM
If the bag don't cost a check
She gonna say we should be friends
Tell the city we back on
Album money lookin' like I'm winnin' a scratch off
Feds fear the kid when he gettin them raps off
Knew niggas was envy on the low
I let the caps fly, now it's hats off
Comin' straight at niggas neck, I'm Captain Levi
Ya family hustle dubious like Tiny and T.I
Gotta be careful with the niggas you choose to stand beside
Was stuck in them quagmires with dudes
That you woulda considered family guys
Crackas in a cold sweat
Dreamin' bout our battle cries
I'm good with all the shootas them hooligans be the family ties

Niggas gotta invest in themselves, bro
Ain't nothin free out here, man
I had to invest in myself, man
Like literally invest, man
I had to come outta pocket, pay for shit
Nigga I didn't no mothafuckin team, bro
I ain't have no push
I ain't got no fuckin major label behind me, bro
Like I had to really invest in myself, man
Y'all niggas do better, man
And it's so crazy because
