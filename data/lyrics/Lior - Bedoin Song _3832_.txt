Leaving the western shadows
Naked in the face of tomorrow
Ooh, and the madness of black desert rain
That lets you rise up and flourish once again
Heading east
Bursting into calm sea like a river released
And the cool night will flow into the heat of the day
I will lose this shadow
I will find my way
Oh, Bedouin song
Is all i really own
Ooh, how strong the temptation to fall
While black desert rain
Runs through my veins
Opening windows of shame
Wild moon above
Go on tell me there is love
I will lose this shadow
I will find my way
Wild moon above
Go on tell me there is love
I will find my inspiration
I will find my way
