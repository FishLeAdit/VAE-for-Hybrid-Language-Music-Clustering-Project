Sleep now sleep
And so fade sorrow
Sleep, beloved, sleep
Sleep now sleep
Afar tomorrow
Sleep, beloved, sleep
You are home, this light
Home of winter
Your home of autumn, summer and spring
You are home, this light
Lasting home
Eternal home, your eternal home
Sleep now sleep
And so fade sorrow
Sleep, beloved, sleep
Sleep now sleep
Afar tomorrow
Sleep, beloved, sleep
Sleep of seven lights upon you
Sleep of seven joys
Sleep of seven slumbers on you
In your hazy poise
You are home, this light
Home of stillness
Your home of spirit, being and bliss
You are home, this light
Abiding home
Forever home, your forever home
Sleep now sleep
And so fade sorrow
Sleep, beloved, sleep
Sleep now sleep
Afar tomorrow
Sleep, beloved, sleep
