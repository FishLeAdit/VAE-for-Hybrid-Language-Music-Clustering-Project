Through a narrow ravine, flattened ferns under feet
Pull a thorn from my knee wading into the creek
I can bleed
Oh, and I know where I belong
Oh, I could never leave you long
Shaken out of my daze by the shrieks of machines
I am weak
A collision of grays, nothing brown, nothing blue, no more green
I can't breathe
NYC, I was in you all along
Don't you see I could never call you home?
