Let's go, yeah

Mama's favorite child
I was vagrant and wild
Even ran with some jealous niggas that hated my style
Had to count up the loss
Double down as a boss
Caught the case, blew a million
Fucking 'round in them courts
Come and get me, I'm down
Niggas mention me now
I was never athletic but fundamentally sound
I was good with my words
Played in Vegas for shows
Not the best MC but got the greatest of flows

Say it loud
Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proud, yeah
Say it loud
Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud, yeah, ooh
Black and I'm proud, yeah
Black and I'm proud
These niggas be get to scheming, I'm clapping 'em down
The people believe it's me that was dragging 'em down
I'm black and I'm proud, yeah, ooh

Fifty grand on the watch
All this bullshit music, they don't know when to stop
They don't know when it's hot
They don't know when to drop
Like I'm back resurrected, they don't know if it's Pac
Hennessy by the gallon, NBC, Jimmy Fallon
ABC, Jimmy Kimmel, twenty chicks in the rental
Lead the way and I follow, it's tomato, tomato
Live every day to the fullest like it ain't no tomorrow
Got a brand new hoopty and it ain't no Impala
It's a V10 Bim', EMG is the team
Niggas laughed at my vision but still proceeded to dream
60 years off my sentence, damn, this nigga's relentless

Say it loud
Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proud, yeah
Say it loud
Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud, yeah, ooh
Black and I'm proud, yeah
Black and I'm proud
These niggas be get to scheming, I'm clapping 'em down
The people believe it's me that was dragging 'em down
I'm black and I'm proud, yeah, ooh

Known to keep a nigga long
In these streets, I'm a don
Fuck police every song
Mama telling me, "Baby, what you preaching is wrong
They in love with your music, you should be teaching them songs"
Should be reading your Bible, getting streams on the Tidal
Not on the roof of Drew Hamilton squeezing off the rifle
I'm addicted to treasures, trick the bitches for pleasure
These are desperate times calling for desperate measures
See I'm black and I'm proud, I can make it a blizzard
Special shout to all my bitches that came up on the visit
Baby Shay brung the dour, Annie Mae brung the powder
Public Enemy, motherfuckers is fighting the power

Say it loud
Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proud, yeah
Say it loud
Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud, yeah, ooh
Black and I'm proud, yeah
Black and I'm proud
These niggas be get to scheming, I'm clapping 'em down
The people believe it's me that was dragging 'em down
I'm black and I'm proud, yeah, ooh

Yeah, like that
