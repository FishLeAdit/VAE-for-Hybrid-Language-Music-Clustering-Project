You tried to tell me something that I
Didn't want to know
You tried to tell me something that I
I felt was preloaded
Oh the only one
Who makes out from what's to come
And oh the anyones
They really wanna be like me
Do easy
Most of the time
When I'm alone
Conducting mind
With ease
Like a poet Burroughs
Self help for a stealthy blow
I saw you clearing out the boxes by your basement bed
That you usually hide
I saw you sweeping up the crumbs of your own deludedness
And I guess I never noticed
All the anyones so defined by what's to come
And oh the only ones
Take stock in what they see
Do easy
Most of the time
When I'm alone
Conducting mind
With ease like a poet Burroughs
Self help for a stealthy blow
Do easy
Like a poet Burroughs
He felt it so fine
He wrote it in prose
With ease if you're so inclined
Cultivated now his sense of mind
Won't try to sign, ah
Lay down the blame, ah
She's been waiting so long
She thinks like a ghost
Will he ever come back
Oh won't you come back
Come back
Come back
Oh won't you come back
Come back
Come back
Oh won't you come back
Do easy
Like a poet Burroughs
Do easy
Do ease
Do ease
Do do do ease
Do do do ease
Do do do ease
Do do do ease
Do do do ease
Do do do ease
Do do do ease
Do do do ease
