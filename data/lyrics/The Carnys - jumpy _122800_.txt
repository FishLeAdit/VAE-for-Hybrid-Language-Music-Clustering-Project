(Jump and dance)
(When you smile) When you see him walking down the street
(When you smile) When he stands and offers you a seat
(When you smile) I can see that I just can’t compete
(Ooh) With the way he’s got you, baby, wants you under his thumb
(Ooh) you’re under his thumb
(Clap your hands) If, if he wants you to
(Clap your hands) He says that it’s so good for you
(Clap your hands) He says it’s what you want to do
(Ooh) With the way he’s got you, baby, wants you under his thumb
(Ooh) You’re under his thumb
(Jump and dance) Jump, jump away from me
(Jump and dance) Oh set, set my baby free
(Jump and dance) She’s mine, she can’t see
(Ooh) The way you got her, there, you want her under you thumb
(Ooh) She’s under your thumb

(Jump and dance)
(Jump and dance)
(Jump and dance) Oh jump, jump away from me
(Jump and dance) Set, set my baby free
(Jump and dance) She’s mine, she just can’t see
(Ooh) The way you got her, there, you want her under you thumb
(Ooh) She’s under your thumb
She’s under your thumb
