Blue eyed baby
Cries in a cradle
Mama said to papa
"Look at them eyes"

Over the ocean
In a great ship
The captain said to the cabin boy
"Look at that water"

And in high places
In the Rockies
I said to Carl
"Look at that valley"

Oh yes
Oh yes
Oh yes

The gardener is gracious
His son is so kind
The lips are his that I've kissed
On the wheel of time

The lips are his that I've kissed

Blue eyed baby

Mama said to papa
"Look at them eyes"

Oh yes, oh yes
Oh yes, oh yes
Oh yes
