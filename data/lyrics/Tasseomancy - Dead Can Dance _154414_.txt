In the summer days, it's fine to be long
Reinvent your ways, fade into folk songs
Just play me some of that old music
Something from the hits you can't go wrong
And smoke it back all my weed and hash
With Neil Young
But the bed's been made and the kids are head strong
Back from whence you came
You're cruel a year long
But there's something in the way again, baby
Tell me what's been going on?
Oh let's just touch to Dead Can Dance and Neil Young
Oh, it gets so cold when you lie
Down on my parade
You say, "Give me one more try, baby, give me one more try"
I say, "How long can you dislocate the meaning, disassociate from mine?"
Oh yes, now we ought to now, that's there's something in the way
Baby, something's in the lake
When you're back this way, I hope you will stay long
Reinvent your ways, fade into folk songs
And we won't have to mash about all this shit between us gone wrong
Oh we'll just touch to Dead Can Dance and Neil Young
Oh, but it gets so cold when you lie
Down on my parade
You say, "Give me one more try, baby, give me one more try"
I say, "How long can you dislocate the meaning, disassociate from mine?"
Oh yes, now we ought to know, that's there's something in the way
Baby, something's in the lake
What's that over me?
I could never be that way
Where are you going?
How have we come undone?
Oh, but it gets so cold when you lie
Down on my parade
You say, "Give me one more try, baby, give me one more try"
I say, "How long can you dislocate the meaning, disassociate from mine?"
Oh yes, now you ought to know, that's there's something in the way
Baby, something's in the lake

A while ago I was gonna take  for something I was trying to do
Look at me
Something's happened, like everybody's clapping or something like that
Look at me, look at me
