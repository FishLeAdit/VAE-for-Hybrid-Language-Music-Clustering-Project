Call me a doctor, I'm going to be sick
Well, I'm burning up I must admit
Well, it's so, so serious
Write me a note for the pharmacy
Prescribe me some pills to mend my heart
Or to stop it completely
I don't want to live without you
I don't want to breathe without your love, your love, your love
Oh, your love, your love, your love
I've had the chills, I've had the spells
But I'm 27 now so what the hell
I can't be this pathetic forever
Turn off the lights and unplug my phone
To pretend I'm out, when I'm still home
Burning up with the fever
I don't want to live without you
I don't want to breathe without your love, your love, your love
Oh, your love, your love, your love
Other guys, I don't care
They don't know the things we shared
Things you write I won't read
Please love me or just leave
(Just leave, just leave, just leave, just leave)
