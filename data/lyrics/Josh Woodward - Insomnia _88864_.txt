Wait, where is my bed, I thought I was there
I swear that I didn't come sit in this chair
But here I am, I guess that's fine
It's only something:49
I'll sleep it off tomorrow if I can
Did I take the pills? I think I'll take more
I thought that I left them here in this drawer
I guess I'll sit and think about
The last time that I took them out
And maybe I will remember where they are
There, drawer
Here, floor
Where, more
Huh
There, bed
Here, bad head
Thr heh huh
