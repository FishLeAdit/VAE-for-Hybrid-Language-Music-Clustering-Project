Wait (Wait)
I know you gotta a lotta shit you’d like to say (To say, to say)
Slow down, think you gettin' lil' carried away
You’re too close, to the flame
But you don’t, wanna turn around
Like you got me figured out

But girl, what I can promise is I won't let you down
So don’t put up a fight
You’ll get lost in the light

If you keep staring at the sun, you won’t see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything I thought it was
Blinded by the thought of this, so
Give me a chance, I will
Fuck up again, I warned
You in advance
But you just keep on starin' at the sun

Wait(Yeah, yeah, wait)
I know that we got a lot of shit going on you see? (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Now you go love someone other than me
I try to rewind, I get reminded that time don't wait for nobody
Can't get too close and don't let it go

'Cause I can count on you to let me drown
I won't put up a fight
I got lost in the light (Oh)

If you keep staring at the sun, you won’t see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything I thought it was
Blinded by the thought of this, so
Give me a chance, I won't
Fuck up again, I warned
In advance
But you just keep on starin' at the sun

Wait
Got a couple little things I would like to say (Oh yeah)
Today is not the day
You shouldn't walk away (Oh yeah)
But you listen, you don't keep on (Oh yeah)

Staring at the sun, you won't see
What you have become, this can’t be
Everything I thought it was
Blinded by the thought of this, so
Give me a chance, I won't
Fuck up again, I warned
You in advance
But you just keep on starin' at the sun
