Humanity's futile resolve for permanence
And the folly of God to infect man's will
One is dealt the hand of creation
And expected to subjugate truth
Contaminating man's will
Even the deepest rivers of Hell can not impede
On our sad lemming trail towards unreality
Descend into the inevitable
Mushroom cloud when time stops
And light and sound finalize at nothing
