And I know
What do you know?
I know together we'll all come back home
And I know
What do you know?
I know together we'll all come back home

Would you pick me up
Throw me in the river and wait a while?
Then you'd fish me up, make a big fire
And hold me tight

And I know
What do you know?
I know together we'll all come back home
And I know
What do you know?
I know together we'll all come back home

We'll all come back home
Home, home, home

Everything will go my way
Even if it isn't there
We will find another better way
It has come and it is gone

Home
Home
Home
Home

And I know
What do you know?
I know together we'll all come back home
And I know
What do you know?
I know together we'll all come back home

We'll all come back home
We'll come home
We'll all come back home
We'll come home
