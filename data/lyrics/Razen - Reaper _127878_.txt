Kill Bill:
Bitch, I’m Nidoking, mobbing wrapped in pyrex
Kaiju-speak with the Kraken's dialect
Every word I say, they try to crack and dissect
Body on the plate, watch that appetite flex
Young man, with a mob fulla mutants
Fuckboy get barred from the movement
Hanging at a hemp bar full of buddhists
EMP em, I could starve a computer
Leech life, TV’ll get my teeth right
Green light, living with it, keep a peace pipe
Young trap lord, card with the hologram
In my tombstone, carve it in monogram
Go on and fuck with it, young hoe (AH)
Total destruction in one blow (AH)
Loss of function, I blunt throw (AH)
My squad kicking thrugh your front door
If you wanna, you can sacrifice for me
Best to hide your fucking face
We gon find you in these streets
Man, them exo demons out
Man, them exo demons out
You can catch me on the corner
Blunt hanging from the mouth
I go hard 
Rav:
It takes a man to kill a demon to redeem one
Packing twenty M16 machine guns
Glock 40 shells in the limousine 
Pop forty pills by the window screen
both middle fingers to the industry 
All fucking weak and uninteresting
EXO will defeat any enemy, 
Float when I speak through the melody
Gold house, keef smoke out the chimney
You lowbrow, keep low, why you envy?
Bitch, i never fucking sold out, empty
Cause all i’ve done is pull my soul out, get free
We’ve assembled now
Anyone opposing us will hence go down
Exo explodes, the crest hits the ground
The quest i obsessed with has finally commenced
I ascend, you bow
If you wan to, you can sacrifice for me
Best to hide your fucking face
We gon find you in these streets
Man, them exo demons out
Man, them exo demons out
You can catch me on the corner
Blunt hanging from the mouth
I go hard
