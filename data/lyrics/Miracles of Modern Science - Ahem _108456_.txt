I was sleeping in a fall
A fool boy humming into a wall
I was stalling, I was stalling, but for what I can't recall
I was seeing through your eyes
But all my objects seemed twice the size
I was counting, I was counting, but its hard to count the sky
I was trying to read your thoughts
But soon I found that my head was lost
I was moving, I was moving, I was moving, moving on
