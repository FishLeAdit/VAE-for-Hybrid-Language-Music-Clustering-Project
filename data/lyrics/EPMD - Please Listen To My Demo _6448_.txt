Yo, what's up, P?
Yo, nothin', man, just coolin'
Kick back in the studio with DJ Scratch, my man Frank B
Reminiscin' about how we was tryna shop our demo
And everyone was dissin', you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, P, tell 'em what's up, man

We was coolin' in my car one day, you see
Clockin' a double nickel on the LIE
When it dawned on us that it was ten o'clock
Turn on the tunes to hear the DJs rock
The hands got to clappin', the fingers got to snappin'
E and I was coolin', Brooklyn spirits we was snappin'
In and out of fantasies on how large we can get
Coolin' in rocks and Benzes with the ground effect kits
I wanted black, E was on the two-tone
Stupid boomin' system with the hands-free phone
The dream gets better and I would like to go on
But I was brought back to reality by a toot of a horn
Smoke everywhere, oh, just what we needed
On the way to shop our demo and the car overheated
Feelin' real low, low enough to die
Holdin' up traffic on the FDR drive
We had to play ourselves in the fresh dipped gear
E Double had to push while MD steered
There went our dreams, to cool with golden limos
And all we kept sayin' was, "Please listen to my demo"

Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo

In the year '87 when we first took off
When I jumped on P-6-8 and broke North
Walkin' the big city streets of Manhattan
Buildings, whole nine yards, so enchantin'
Thinkin' if we got a chance, we could rock it
Funky-fresh demo tape in my pocket
We was walkin', and got dissed twice today
Then we stopped at 1974 Broadway
We walked in with grins on our chins
And P had juice with Mr. Virgil Simms
He played the tape and we started to laugh
Played it for Will Soc' and the Sleeping Bag staff
People started smilin', inside we buck wildin'
Sayin' this all started back from freestylin'
They liked it and they was very kind
But me and P was like, "Yo, E, where do we sign?"
Went in the back room, things was lovey-dovey
Met Ron Resnick and his partner Juggy
Things was cool as I remembered
We signed the dotted line, now we Fresh Record members
Had dreams of fancy cars and limos
And all I wanted was somebody to listen to my demo

Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Ple-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo

Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
