Brad's full of crap

Note twisted to the max I'm
In the middle of a charming second
I'm in change with the tune of action
All I wanted was a little reaction

Don't be hanging around my friend I said I'm
All twisted up in wires
And even though you know it's best
You never get out, you never get out

So strange when you're out confessin'
In the trench with the trails impressin'
I never wanted to learn my lesson
All I wanted was a little attention
