Sure and swift in the winless race
Set free as an opened cage
Withered mind to regain
Your secret's fall like whispered rain
And the night it holds like a met gaze
Your mirror knows
The sudden flight through the gate aflame
Wake and rise, it could be all life
If you let the reigns and lean, lean in

Get up out your way, get up out your way
When it calls you near, calls you near
It can try to hold as I scrеam out, the burn
Of want, the cold of doubt, therе is only this
No pretend, no begin, and no end
Your secret's catch like a hidden throat
Your mirror knows the sudden-flight…
Can you let it lead… let lead… let…
