I can see in your eyes that you mean it
I can feel in your arms that it's true
And though I just heard myself say it
Baby, I'm lying to you
Baby, I'm lying to you

In all of these years you've been lonely
And knowing not what you should do
And though you are right, I've been looking as well
Babe, I'm not looking for you
Babe, I'm not looking for you

I'm just as damn disappointed as you
Only I just do better to hide it
And the one thing that keeps me from falling for you
Is I'm truly alone and I like it
Yeah, I'm truly alone and I like it

As we lie in bed, I feel lonely
Though we're young, I feel eighty years old
And your arms around me are keeping me warm
But baby, I'm still feeling cold
Baby, I'm still feeling cold

And, girl, you must know you are lovely
You're kind and you're beautiful, too
And I feel in some way I do love you
But babe, I'm not in love with you
Babe, I'm not in love with you

And it may seem strange that I still stay with you
If it's true you're not really the one
And why don't I just keep on looking for her?
'Cause I found her, but now she is gone
'Cause I found her, but now she is gone
'Cause I found her, but now she is gone
'Cause once I found her, but now she is gone
