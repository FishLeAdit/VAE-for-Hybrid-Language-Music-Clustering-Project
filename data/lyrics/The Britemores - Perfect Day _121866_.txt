I want to go back to that perfect day
Where the rays streamed in on me
Take me back to that perfect day
With the stairs beneath my feet

The world was mine, I hadn't a care
I felt fine, everything was clear
Light cast shadows on this perfect day
The air was sweet with spring

Dust drifted down on this perfect day
And the colors formed around
The world was mine, I hadn't a care
I felt fine, everything was clear

I felt the carpet between my toes
My hand braced on a sill
Leaning forward I peered out
But I got a sudden chill

The corner caved in, I lost control
There is no time to save my soul

I looked down and the floor was gray
The walls were clean and white
A brilliant sound outside filled the air
But something around me felt so tight

The corner caved in, I lost control
There is no time to save my soul
The corner caved in, I lost control
There is no time to save my soul

Please bring me back to that perfect day
I haven't the strength to beg
Soon they're about to close the door
Sending my regards from the cell born boy
