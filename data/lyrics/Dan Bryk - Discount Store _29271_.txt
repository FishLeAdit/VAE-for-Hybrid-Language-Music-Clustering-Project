I’m going to the discount store
Yeah I’m going to the discount store
Can’t afford what I used to afford and I hardly even noticed

I’m going to the discount store
Yeah I’m going to the discount store
Can’t afford what I used to afford
And I hardly even noticed
Know this

Knowing that the world’s an awful great big place
And I am awful small
It really shouldn’t come as much of a surprise
To find i don’t really matter at all

Mom and dad don’t let me waste your time
Mom and dad don’t let me waste your time
I know you’ve got to be at work by nine
To keep food upon the platter

Mom and dad don’t let me waste your time
Mom and dad don’t let me waste your time
I know you’ve got to be at work at nine
As if it really mattered
Mattered

Mattered that the clock needs punching
The man is watching
And the union’s gone for good
With all this freedom how come there’s no fun
Left in the neighborhood?

A&R woman has central air
A&R woman has central air
Every day I walk up three flights of stairs
And it’s getting hot this summer

Label president has got health care
Label president has got health care
Every day I walk up three flights of stairs
And it’s really hot this summer
Bummer

Bummer that the world’s a great big awful place
And frequently unfair
It really shouldn’t come as much of a surprise
That there’s just not enough to share
Aaaaaaah

We're going to the discount store
Yeah we're going to the discount store
Can’t afford what we used to afford
And we hardly even noticed
