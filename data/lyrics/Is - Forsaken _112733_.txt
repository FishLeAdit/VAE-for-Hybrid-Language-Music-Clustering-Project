Eternal war, I'm seeing backwards
I see the lights flash, I found a light source
I just wanna break down, right down from my core
I really hate them, that's why I gotta pull the trigger on the gun
 (skky)
Just for fun, all at once just cause they told me that I never could've won
(Ha we just having fun, they all know that I'm the one) Asterisk* just has begun (We turning 3 into one)
 (skky)
Break down fall back, we turning 3 into one
Break down fall back, I'm giving you what you want
You what you want from the start, asterisk* just has begun
We turning 3 into one
Act like I'm already done, baby we gonna have fun I got too much you got nonе, I'm giving you what you want
You what you want from the start
Asterisk* just has begun, wе turning 3 into one
 (isaiah)
Girl I don’t need you, I just need my bag
You sit there and regret what you coulda had
I can’t help but wonder why you care so much about the past
And I can’t help but think it’s such a shame how you just turned your back
 (isaiah)
Can’t stop running, I’m almost there
See the flash of the tunnel, I hate that glare
Yeah, say what you want, I see your stare
I know for a fact you wish you were here
I’m sick and tired, you’re all the same
It’s just me and my brothers until the end
Yeah, set that fire, you’ll end up dead
They try to bring me down, but I don’t care
 (skky)
Break down fall back, we turning 3 into one
Break down fall back, I'm giving you what you want
You what you want from the start, asterisk* just has begun
We turning 3 into one
Act like I'm already done, baby we gonna have fun I got too much you got none, I'm giving you what you want
You what you want from the start
Asterisk* just has begun, we turning 3 into one
