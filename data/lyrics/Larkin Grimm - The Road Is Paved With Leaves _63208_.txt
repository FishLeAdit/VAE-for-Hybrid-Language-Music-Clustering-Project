(Verse 1)
I know, you're like a wild rose, you're like a train wreck, my darlin'
You're always amazing to see even when you are failing
There is nothing, nothing to worry about
Everything's fine. Don't go out of your mind
(Chorus)
The road is paved with leaves
And all along the way is lined with flowers and trees
There is nothing, nothing to worry about
Everything's fine. Don't go out of your mind
(Verse 2)
I know that, in your darkest days, I will hear you callin'
But I can't even speak your name for fear I'll be fallin' again
There is nothing, nothing to worry about
Everything's fine. Don't go out of your mind
(Chorus)
'Causе the road is paved with leavеs
And all along the way is lined with flowers and trees
There is nothing, nothing to worry about
Everything's fine. Don't go out of your mind
(Verse 3)
You know and I know we'll both be here in the morning
Hoping that the air is still sweet and the sun is still shining
There is nothing, nothing to worry about
Everything's fine. Don't go out of your mind
(Outro)
The road of life is paved with leaves
And all along the way is lined with flowers and trees
There is nothing, nothing to worry about
Everything's fine. Don't go out of your mind
Everything's fine. Don't go out of your mind
