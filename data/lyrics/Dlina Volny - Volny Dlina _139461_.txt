Been trying
To crash the wrong party
On my last day
On earth
Been wanting
To catch you on an outing
But you’re running away
From my call
'Cause if you wanna call me
Do it now
If you wanna
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it

Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it

If you wanna live fun
Live
If you wanna die
Don’t please
If you wanna call me
Do it please
If you wanna
Doing, doing, doing, doing
Doing, doing
Doing, doing doing
