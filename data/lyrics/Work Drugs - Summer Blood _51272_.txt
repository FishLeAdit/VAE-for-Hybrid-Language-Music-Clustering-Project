This is our love, love, love, love charity
Cause summer blood, blood, blood, blood feels the same
Seasons always seem to tie us down
Swimmin’ in the streets of this tired town
Seven different ways to hold your hand
Is it up to me to understand?
This is our love, love, love, love charity
Cause summer blood, blood, blood, blood feels the same
Is it up to me?
