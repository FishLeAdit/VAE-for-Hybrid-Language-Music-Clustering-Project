I'm all alone and my phone ain't working
I'm in a garden with the birds all chirping
I won't be able to make it up to you in time
But just remember you'll forever be mine
I see you from afar as blossoms fall down on the ground
You're the only beautiful girl in this town
I never knew love could make you drown
Automatic tears drop when I hear your sound

Step, step, step back
Gotta problem, I'ma shoot you, one tap
Relapse, make it last
Fuck that I don't wanna go back
Press pause, rewind
I just wanna see you smile one more time
I'm sad, down bad
Yеah, I know that none of this will last
Wait, wait, wait, wait
What was the last thing that you told me?
Fatе, fate, fate, fate
Isn't that what you said when you found me?
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Miss the sound of your voice can you hold me?
Fate, fate, fate, fate
Thought you told me I was your only

I'm all alone and my phone ain't working
I'm in a garden with the birds all chirping
I won't be able to make it up to you in time
But just remember you'll forever be mine
I see you from afar as blossoms fall down on the ground
You're the only beautiful girl in this town
I never knew love could make you drown
Automatic tears drop when I hear your sound
