It doesn’t matter
It all makes sense for all I know
It’s the same thing that has come that will go
I tried to speak up
(most of the time I was muzzled by a joke)
But inspiration took a break and I choked
I said I’d give an eye for you
But that was just a lie
I said I’d be the catcher in the rye for you
But that was just a lie
I said I’d fight and die for you
But that was just a lie
I said I’d steal the sun from the sky for you
But that was just a lie
I just closed my eyes for you
It’s just a cycle
Didn’t we all find out long ago?
From Hemingway to The Crystals
From de Sade to Sade
It doesn’t matter
It all makes sense for all I know
Those starry eyes will glisten
Till the waves reach the cove
I said I’d give an eye for you
But that was just a lie
I said I’d be the catcher in the rye for you
But that was just a lie
I said I’d fight and die for you
But that was just a lie
I said I’d steal the sun from the sky for you
But that was just a lie
I just closed my eyes
I only closed my eyes
I just closed my eyes for you
