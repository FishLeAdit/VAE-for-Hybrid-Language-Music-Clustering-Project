I'll make you mine
I'll make you mine
I'll make you mine
Though it will take time
Time that I have lost
I'll make you mine
I'll make you mine
You haunt me so
I can't let go
If I can't have you, then what will I do
For the memory of you clings to me
I'll make you mine
I'll make you mine
Wake up, wake up, wake up
I've been dreaming forever of you
Wake up, wake up, wake up
There is nothing else I can do
I'll make you mine
Don't tell me lies
I hate your eyes
When I look away, then you always say
How you need me, but I don't see
I'll make you mine
I'll make you mine
Wake up, wake up, wake up
I've been dreaming forever of you
Wake up, wake up, wake up
There is nothing else I can do
I'll make you mine
I'll make you mine
I'll make you mine
