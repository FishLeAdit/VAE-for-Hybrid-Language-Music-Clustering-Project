Sometimes I just want to collapse into you, you
But I don't know if you want me to
Or, if I should?
Shouldn't I be okay out here on my own?
Living in my little home?
No needs from others, doing it all by myself
Before I would've escaped into arms, too quickly
But touch is still necessary
So hold me now, tell me it's okay
And I'll tell you the same
Sometimes I...I just want to collapse into you
So as to ground me
Like hugging a tree
You're part of the earth that helps balance me
