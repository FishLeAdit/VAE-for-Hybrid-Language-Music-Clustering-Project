The night is late for all of us
And if we don't, we'll never know
We'll never know

Say you will, you will

Don't be shy, look to the sky
'Cause all the stars are on your side
They're on your side

Say you will, you will
Say you will, you will

Don't be shy, look to the sky
'Cause all the stars are on your side
They're on your side
