Trees caught fire, sky turned red
Fish in the river turned up dead
Water still rising, no sign of a storm
The sun don't shine to keep us warm
I sent a prayer, a prayer up to the Lord
I'm still waiting, waiting on my reward

Some rivers run deep, some run wide
Some run dark, their secrets to hide
I sent a prayer, a prayer up to the Lord
I'm still waiting, waiting on my reward

Don't let it rain, don't let it pour
Don't let the wind blow through my door
I sent a prayer, a prayer up to the Lord
I'm still waiting, waiting on my reward

How did I get here, lucky to be alive
Sometimes you live, but sometimes you just drive
I sent a prayer, a prayer up to the Lord
I'm still waiting, waiting on my reward
