Verse 1
Like an Al Green record
I’m caught in a real good groove
Little slow down in my head
Got a new step in my boots
Got some miles on me like this truck
But we’re running good as we ever was
Yeah the more I'm makin' it
The more I've been takin' it
Chorus
One cold beer at a time
Tippin' it back and lettin' it flow
Takin' the lows and ridin' the highs
As it comes and as it goes
A little more sip than shoot
A little more chill than makin' moves
I’m getting by and taking life
One cold beer at a time
Versе 2
As soon as I quit looking
Some down home blue еyes came around
It's still too soon to tell
But it could be something worth bringing home about
I don't know where it's gonna go
But I know we're gonna find out
Chorus
One cold beer at a time
Tippin' it back and lettin' it flow
Takin' the lows and ridin' the highs
As it comes and as it goes
A little more sip than shoot
A little more chill than makin' moves
I’m getting by and taking life
One cold beer at a time
Bridge
There's still times I'm an all-out hundred proofer
But things sure go down smoother
Chorus
One cold beer at a time
Tippin' it back and lettin' it flow
Takin' the lows and ridin' the highs
As it comes and as it goes
A little more sip than shoot
A little more chill than makin' moves
I’m getting by and taking life
One cold beer at a time
One cold beer at a time
One cold beer at a time
