I'm looking at you in a photo
You're in your baby pool
That was such a hot day
You were so happy
I was so tired and lonely
You smiled right at me
I tried to smile back
But you saw I was faking it
I felt so bad for that
There were some people
Around us at the time
Who weren't for us though
They claimed to be
You see on my face it was effecting me
There was a lot of warmth
In that time though
But look how heavy the clouds were
How saturated our sky was
We came through it, sweetheart
