Born November
Can’t  here my own noise
I’m speaking loud let my pastor hear
You’re my closest fear
My voice is clear
My voice is cracking
Because My minds in tears
My vice is my dearest
Cut my skin open
Take a picture in the mirror
Writing songs for my kids
They dad is a disappointment
Missed my doctors appointments
Overdosing on my medication
Losing my dedication
I know hell for me
I can’t wait to see evine
Coming out smiling
I’m done whiling
I know Imma make i
You know I love you

I’m deep in this shit
I don’t mean to cry like a bitch
My hearts in a bottomless pit
I swear ima lose to the drug addiction
I hope my future kids see me as
A role model not a disappointment
I love you
I hope you see me
I fucking love you
