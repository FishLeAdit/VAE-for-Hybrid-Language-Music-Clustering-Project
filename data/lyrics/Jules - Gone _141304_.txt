Last night the constellations
Watched me walk at half past twelve
With some people you don’t see the whole picture at once
Like you fill in the gaps in the stars all by yourself

Who has time in this world of worry
Drives you crazy, makes you mad
Then you make the mistake just a little too late
You're missing something now that you never knew you had

So how do I answer these blues you say I've got
Too soon gone, too soon gone
Time makes me pay for thesе memories I've bought
And you'rе too soon gone, you're too soon gone

No one lives forever
Who would want to
But you're too soon gone, you're too soon gone

Pretty soon now all this ice will melt
The buds will get ready to break
But every leaf that grows
In the language that it knows
Says the winter will return here, these trees are gonna shake

So how do I answer these blues you say I got?
Too soon gone, too soon gone
Time sweeps me forward, but this memory is caught
And you're too soon gone, you're too soon gone
Too soon gone, too soon gone
