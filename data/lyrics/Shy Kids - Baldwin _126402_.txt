New home
New face
Same shoe
New lace
Old coat
Old cane
Same note
Refrain
Stay lofty!
I know our heads get better once it all fits between us
I'll walk in any weather if distance means we'll team up
Never let it grow from me, bound to a bed and blanket
I know that my home will be wherever i have made it
If these walls could talk
I know what they'd say
They'd tell us a joke
'bout the good old days
(new home)
Stay lofty!
Stay!
