Escuse me the indiscretion
But I've got this sensation
That you and I could go places
Forget all about their faces yeah
You've got something that I adore
You always leave me begging for more
I'm patient but believe me
I'm craving attention and all I'm saying is
I-I've been wondering all night night
So why don't you come by-by
'Cause lately I feel like
We could be on to something
I-I got sparkle in my eye
You make me come ali-live
You always make me, you always
Make me feel like
Escuse me the indiscretion
But I've got this sensation
That you and I could be on
To something amazing
Don't you know that I'm craving
Attention, but all I'm saying
Is that latetly you've been crossing
My mind and it feels like
I-I've been wondering all night night
So why don't you come by-by
'Cause lately I feel like
We could be on to something
I-I got sparkle in my eye
You make me come ali-live
You always make me, you always
Make me feel like
You Make me feel like
You Make me feel like
You make me feel like
I've got butterflies, all over flying all over
You make me feel like
I got a ray of sunshine
You're my private sunshine
I-I've been wondering all night night
So why don't you come by-by
'Cause lately I feel like
We could be on to something
I-I got sparkle in my eye
You make me come ali-live
You always make me, you always
Make me feel like
You Make me feel like
You Make me feel like
