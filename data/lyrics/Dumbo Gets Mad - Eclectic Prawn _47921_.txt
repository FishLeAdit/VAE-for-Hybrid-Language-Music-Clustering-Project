Eclectic prawn, galactic prawn
This is the story of eclectic prawn
He wears a little pretty crown
Dancing through the bubbles
He is now standing on the bottom of the sea
He knows his look thanks to the eyeballs
Of the fishes swimming nearby his throne
He may be fooled by those reflections
As it happens even up in the shore
Eclectic prawn, galactic prawn
He's regarded like a king
Of the sea he never talked to me
I still think he is a gentleman i
Don't wanna bother him until i might
And now it's time to visit his castle
I hope i'll know who i am
I'm sure i'll find good vibes
Hot salty sparkling water
