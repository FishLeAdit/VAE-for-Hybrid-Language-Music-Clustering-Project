I've got a love
A hot-rod ride
Push button start
And five wheel drive
I've got a love
Eight miles high
Chrome plated stars
On a black leather sky
I've got a heart
Made of steel
Platinum thumbs
And a gold plated heel
I've got a love
Seven leagues down
Longer than time
And higher than sound
I've got a love
