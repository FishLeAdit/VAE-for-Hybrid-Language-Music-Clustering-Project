Do you think I’ve paid enough for how I’ve hurt you?
Do you think you’ve paid enough for all you did?
We seem to need the pain
To feed the passion
Never solve this with a kiss
All it is is ignorance and bliss

Forgive but not forget tonight
Remember something we did right
What’s mine is yours and yours is mine
So could we
Hold each other through the night
Accept the things we always fight
I said I hated you, I lied, badly
When I think I’ve had enough
When I think I’ve given up
I look at you and just my luck
I’m screwed
‘Cause I still love you
‘Cause I still love you

All I want to say is I’m grateful
But I swear you won’t believe me if I do
For everything you are, I am crazy
It drives me keeps me hanging on
But you and I won’t always be this young

Forgive but not forget tonight
Remember something we did right
What’s mine is yours and yours is mine
So could we
Hold each other through the night
Accept the things we always fight
I said I hated you, I lied, badly
When I think I’ve had enough
When I think I’ve given up
I look at you and just my luck
I’m screwed
‘Cause I still love you
‘Cause I still love you
