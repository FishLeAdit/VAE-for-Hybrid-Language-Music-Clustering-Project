It's a one way ticket and I'm not on it
It's a one way ticket and I'm not on it
It's a one way ticket and I'm not on it

I see the trees blossom early again
The pink flowers draped over vines
No longer a danger to men to cross, cross here

It's a one way ticket and I'm not on it
It's a one way ticket and I'm not on it

And the dogs are long gone
The men in uniforms brandishing guns
No walls in this city
Different divides, different divides

It's a one way ticket and I'm not on it
It's a one way ticket and I'm not on it

Callused and burning, the stations are holding pens
For those who fell through
We're still divided by different walls
Now there's flying cars and greasing palms

It's a one way ticket and I'm not on it
It's a one way ticket and I'm not on it
It's a one way ticket and I'm not on it
It's a one way ticket and I'm not on it

The city didn't learn the lessons of its past
Making deals with the snakes and the sharks
The city didn't learn the lessons of its past
Building walls, building walls and money rules

Money rules
Money rules
Money rules

It's a one way ticket and I'm not on it
It's a one way ticket and I'm not on it
It's a one way ticket and I'm not on it
It's a one way ticket and I'm still on it
