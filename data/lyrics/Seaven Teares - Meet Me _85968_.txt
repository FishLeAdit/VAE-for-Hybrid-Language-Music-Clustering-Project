Meet me where you blush
Meet me at your skin
Kiss me through the bars
Unsmiling in pleasure
Meet me where you end
Where the world begins
Holes instead of eyes
Unsmiling in pleasure

Rush, rush to your surface
Come to your limit and play
Meet me there for an hour
And then we'll run back away
Two souls separately buried
Each in our own dumb meat
Neither one wants to feel like another
Thing in this world of things

Meet me
Meet me
Meet me

Meet me whеre you blush
Meet me at your skin
Kiss me through thе bars
Unsmiling in pleasure
Meet me where you end
Where the world begins
Holes instead of eyes
Unsmiling in pleasure

The more I grab at your hated parts
And search you like a corpse
The more your tiny light peeks out
Is there anyone in there?
I burn with contempt like the alchemist
Redeeming this world of lead
White heat and blistering chemicals
Will tease gold out from the dead

Meet me
Meet me
Meet me

Meet me where you blush
Meet me at your skin
Kiss me through the bars
Unsmiling in pleasure
Meet me where you end
Where the world begins
Holes instead of eyes
Unsmiling in pleasure
Meet me where you blush
Meet me at your skin
Kiss me through the bars
Unsmiling in pleasure
Meet me where you end
Where the world begins
Bars of coke await us there
And then we'll flee to separate rooms to cry
