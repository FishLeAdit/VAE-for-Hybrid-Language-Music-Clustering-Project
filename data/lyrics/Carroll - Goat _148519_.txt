She say I'm the G.O.A.T
Whatever I say go
She wanna hold my strap, she wanna hold my pole
She wanna see the map, wanna go around the globe
She know it ain't no cap in my rap episode
Chrome Heart fit
Cartier lens
AMG Benz
President tint
Game in the tent
Ride wit' a stick
Pull up, get hit
Diamonds, they hit

I leave 'em sick
I got some VVS right on my wrist
She wanna see me, yeah, she take a trip
Yeah, she don't wanna leave me, yeah, she hang on the dick
She wet like the sea, yeah, she waterfall drip
That's my lil' rider
I stand beside her
This shit don't expire
Lil' baby she hot, yeah, hot like a fire
She call me sire
She know I admire
She grip on that dick just like some pliers
Finna give her a rock, let's build a empire
Spilled lean on the rocks but I never get tired
Yeah, ride in that drop, Pirelli tires

She say I'm the G.O.A.T
Whatever I say go
She wanna hold my strap, she wanna hold my pole
She wanna see the map, wanna go around the globe
She know it ain't no cap in my rap episode
