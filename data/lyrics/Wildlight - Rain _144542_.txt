Oh rain giving life
For an instant I tasted your tears
Oh gods of the sky
Wash away our dust and all of these fears
Oh rain, oh rain, oh rain, oh rain, oh rain
Oh rain giving life
For an instant I tasted your tears
Oh gods of the sky
Wash away our dust and all of these fears
Oh song on the wind
I can taste you as you roll across these plains
All seen, all within
So gather waters let me feel this pain
Melt into rain (oh rain, oh rain, oh rain, oh rain, oh rain)
Oh rain giving life
For an instant I tasted your tears
Oh gods of the sky
Wash away our dust and all of these fears
Oh song on the wind
I can taste you as you roll across these plains
All seen, all within
So gather waters let me feel this pain
Melt into rain
