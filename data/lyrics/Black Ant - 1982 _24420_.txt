Black and violet
The colours of your funeral
Before the kiss of worms
And the embrace of age
A rainbow without colours
Are the last image
And now I can see your haze
Anymore rainbow
Of colours of your last image
And now I can see your haze (anymore)
Before the kiss of worms
And the embrace of age
Black and violet
