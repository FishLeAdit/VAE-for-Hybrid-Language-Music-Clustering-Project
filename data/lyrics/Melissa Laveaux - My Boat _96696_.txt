My Boat, sweet anger, sweet salvage, Cast anchor upon my fingers
We'll travel but linger
On thougts, the coasts of past hopes, eroded with tears, teardrops
We'll take it slow or to the tempo of the shadows. Pretend to be lost in the world of clef notes
Me and My Boat
You've got no sails, you won't give in to the winds. As far as eyes can tell. You indulge my every whim. Each stroke soaked in passion

Me and My Boat
Et dans mes voyages musicaux je rêve de long en large. Enfouie dans mon bateau. Accroupie, enivree entre les cordes de vynile. Admirant le beau paysage, le gros paysage. Paysage en clé de sol
