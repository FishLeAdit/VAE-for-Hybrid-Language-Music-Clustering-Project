I swear I'll do better next time, maybe twice is enough
I tried to make friends with the tide, tried to call your bluff
Free is all she ever could be, defeated by this love
We tried to make friends with the tide, tried to call its bluff
Bright colours in this solvent reality
Maybe twice, twice is enough
Names written on walls that I can't read
Maybe twice, twice is enough
Maybe twice is enough
I swear I'll do better next time, maybe twice is enough
It's all about sweat in the end, and this is all just stuff
Bright colours in this solvent reality
Maybe twice, twice is enough
Names written on walls that I can't read
Maybe twice, twice is enough
Maybe twice is enough
