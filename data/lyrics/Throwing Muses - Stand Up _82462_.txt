And the night
Frightening dark and
It was light
A big tree branches and
I was dancing
I'm straining
My broken neck and walking fast
Look at my glasses then
Look at her shoes
Break your arm, it ain't no face
Wear shoes, jealous, fuck you, stand up
(And I stare)
I wish you were a house to me
Frightening light so
Keep it dark
Keep your lights low so
I can't see inside
She runs
To the big people, but listen to me
I know
Break your arm, it ain't no face
Wear shoes, jealous, fuck you, stand up
(And I fall)
I look
What does she put on now?
Every day
Do you love her more than me?
All night long
Break your arm, it ain't no face
Wear shoes, jealous, fuck you, stand up
(And I scream)
