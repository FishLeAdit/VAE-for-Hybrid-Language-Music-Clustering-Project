Capture me burning in the midnight downtown
Streetlights around
Pictures are perfect for the outcasts and the outcrowds go down
To the seedy part of town
Where everyone is free to get down
That’s where you'll find us there
From dusk to dawn the outcast rule this town
Can you see it's coming over the airwaves?
Can’t you see its clear cause you’re in my eyes?
And you want to see it, your salvation
Don't you know the sky will be ours tonight?
Can you see it's coming over the airwaves?
Can’t you see its clear cause you’re in my eyes?
And you want to be it, your salvation
Don't you know the sky will be ours tonight?
Pictures are perfect for the outcast and the outcrowd go down
Complicated seduction always happens in this downtown
Can't you see the I want you in my eyes?
Your walk says, you lack attention
Your intentions are true but your moves tell lies
Seduction, complication
Can't you see the I want you in my eyes?
Your walk says, you lack attention
Your intentions are true but your moves tell lies
Capture me burning in the midnight downtown
