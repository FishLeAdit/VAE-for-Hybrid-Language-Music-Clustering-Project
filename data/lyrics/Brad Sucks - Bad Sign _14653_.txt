I was laying
On the floor when you were gone
Like it was something I could die from
Now my head aches
And your friends all think I'm dumb
You said it's just a bit of bad blood
I don't feel great
But it doesn't bother me
Because I don't have the energy
And the X-ray
Doesn't tell me anything
Or show me what the hell you see in me
All my time has turned to days
That I will waste 'til my dying day
And all my bones have realigned
And now, I guess it was a bad sign
I was praying
To the Lord for some fun
But I guess He didn't have some
I'm betraying
Everything that I'd become
Just to prove it wasn't true love
If I'm too late
Will you come and hurry me
Like a kid among the dying leaves?
If my heart breaks
Will you drug and carry me
Where we can talk about our chemistry?
All my time has turned to days
That I will waste 'til my dying day
And all my bones have realigned
And now, I guess it was a bad sign
And now, I guess it was a bad sign
All my time has turned to days
That I will waste 'til my dying day
And when I tried, I was ashamed
And said I don't believe in saving face
And all my clothes are still inside
And broken up into little piles
And all my bones have realigned
And now, I guess it was a bad sign
And now, I guess it was a bad sign
And now, I guess it was a bad sign
