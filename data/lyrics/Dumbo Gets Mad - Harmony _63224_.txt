All the sudden they were saying
Proctor has no one else to blame
I can now move on to my turn
I know the words to be in my lane
Oh no
I've nothing to explain
Come on you can’t complain
Wow
You can meet and maybe end it

Why does the waterfall go on
Why does the waterfall go on
I'm just trampling up on you
I'm just trampling up on you
I’m just trampling up on you

Let's just walk in harmony
Let's just walk in harmony
Let's just walk in harmony
Let's just walk in harmony

Oh wow, the sound persists were so high
Would shoot your soul black piece every time
But I cannot help myself
I don't know what I've time for again

I'm just trampling up on you
I’m just trampling up on you

Let’s just walk in harmony
Let's just walk in harmony
Let’s just walk harmony
Just walk harmony
