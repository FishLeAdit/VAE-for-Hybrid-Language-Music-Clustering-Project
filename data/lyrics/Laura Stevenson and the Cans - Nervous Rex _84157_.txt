All the blips of the sinking ships
Are all sinking into your skin
And I'm feeling older as my hair goes white
And I can not light up the dark
And all the violent waves
And I haven't left the house in 100 years
And you haven't left yours in 100 hours
And we can't keep our hands out of our own mouths
See the horrible habits we acquire
And all the rawest thumbs
From gnawing on them and rowing hard
You're a nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck
You're a nervous wreck
And how my stomach burns, but only at night
When the moon is bright
And I have dreams about bears
With the reddest mouths
But your arms are warm
And your legs are wrapped around
And the sound of your heart
The unsteady sound, I will slow it down
