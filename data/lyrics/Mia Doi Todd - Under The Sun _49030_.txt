I am the ocean
You are the salt in my sea
The cream in my coffee
Honey in my tea
Maybe we should spend the summer
Maybe we should spend some time together
Under the sun
I am the ocean
You are the land
My deep devotion
Crashes on your sand
Maybe we should spend the summer
Maybe we should spend this life together
Under the sun
I am the ocean
You are the wind in my sail
We drink my love potion
We are steep in the gail
Maybe we should spend the summer
Baby, we should spend the winter
Under the sun
