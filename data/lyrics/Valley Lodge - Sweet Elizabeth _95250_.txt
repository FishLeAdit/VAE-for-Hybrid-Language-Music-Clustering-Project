Well hey there high school stranger
So very nice to meet you
She was a cruel cruel Countess
Who killed her every mistress
To keep her young and fresh faced
She bathed in blood
Bathed in blood
No matter what they said
She'd cut them off and left them there for dead
And every scene she leaves
Looks like something from the land of make believe
Sweet Elizabeth
Sweet Elizabeth
She had a great big wedding
Just as the sun was setting
There was an endless guest list
Anything for the Countess
And when she disappeared, she
She stole their hearts
Stole their hearts
All of this and more
She'd lure them in and then she'd close the door
None of them would leave
A goodbye kiss would be the last they'd breathe
Sweet Elizabeth
Sweet Elizabeth
They locked her in a room
Sealed up with bricks to guarantee her doom
But still she would live on
To capture hearts into oblivion
Sweet Elizabeth
Sweet Elizabeth
