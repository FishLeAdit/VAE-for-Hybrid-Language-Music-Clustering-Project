Dancing around the mushroom cloud
Dancing around the mushroom cloud
Is naivety the burden? or is the burden learning?
Bare-bum children running thru the sprinklers
Bare-bum children running thru the sprinklers
Fill your lungs up with whimsy
Existence is so flimsy
GROW UP SLOWLY
Life stays mysterious if you stay curious
GO BACK TO SLEEP
Chase your dreams in the dark, catch 'em when you wake up
Instant coffee
Instant camera
Instant winner
Instant satisfaction
Life is over in an instant
So why you gotta insist that we stay
Dancing around the mushroom cloud
Dancing around the mushroom cloud
Is naivety the burden? or is the burden learning?
Grow up slowly
Life stays mysterious if you stay curious
Go back to sleep
Chase your dreams in the dark, catch 'em when you wake up
Little noodie
Life stays mysterious if you stay curious
Go back to sleep
Chase your dreams in the dark, catch 'em when you wake up
Slowly growing up right! (grow up slowly)
Slowly growing up right! (grow up slowly)
Slowly growing up right! (grow up slowly)
Slowly growing up right! (grow up slowly)
Chase your dreams in the dark, catch 'em when you wake up
