Indian Summers
Are always awkward, I think
Warn orange air
Cold apartments
Open windows and cars
Sharing a city and basement floors
Don't waste time in case we think twice
Don't waste time, in case we think twice
Tore my shirt
Living a lie
Shed my guilt til there was no regret
Messed up a situation by not making it happen
Together on Sundays
West coast states are a dream
Don't waste time in case we think twice
Indian Summers
Are always awkward, I think
Warm orange air
Cold apartments
Open windows and cars
Together on Sundays
West coast states are a dream
Don't waste time in case we think twice
