Yo
See when we started
We had no idea 'bout being honest
Wanted to spit sixty four bars over guitar riffs
That hardship
The six minute tracks are hard to market
But I say real music heads ain't hard to target
, 'specially if you ain't feeling the garbage
I'm heartless, when I hear the beats so heartless
We went studio, we did this shit in Bla's crib
With  lit and big bottles all over the carpet
We mix a million genres
If anyone asks this guitar piff
Home grown, you better spark it ()
On a mission to bring 'em all out
With the spirit of Jim Morrison to kick your doors down
Raw sound
Coming to  you in your town
We shoot so many bars we need some more rounds
So it's more rounds, but applause we don't do this for
The cause is the force for these weed smoking 
You recall, inside the parameters
The world is our oyster, we skip by any barriers
Art, and you know we armed with a fusion of all these hearts
For pursuing our only paths and our youth is our only chance
We don't roll'n up believin' there's no love so I'm stuck
'Til my souls up for leaving
Shout out to Klashnekoff for no fucking reason
We that all singing, all dancing, in your face, no pardons
Listen make some new shit, come to expand rapping
This is life music, jump on the bandwagon
Let's go

Left or right is the question now
'Cause we're figuring our direction out
But really we're just like you
So we're taking you for the ride to
You wanna roll, come through
You wanna roll, come through

Some live along the river banks
Some live on the sea
Some 
Of the higher 
Some live in four walls
Some live underground
Some search for freedom
And some search just to be found

We don't know where we're going
We don't know where we're going
We don't know where we're going
We don't know where we're going

(Hello)
Is anybody out there
We're proud without care
No doubt, I shout 'cause the game don't sound fair
Round here motherfuckers try and take your soul
When the shit goes down kid you better know your role
I remember when I had myself a studio at 
Forty man rushed but tryna to take my keys
Shout out to Salar for the other time he bagged and beefed
Do something positive and lose to these deceitful streets
What a shame but it's all good, see me in my rays
Fillin' my days in the most insidious ways
I was a brilliant brain just made for killin' this game
When I lose in the booth all my feelings the same
Which way to go like a game of Monopoly
Real estate on mind but the fakes are hot property
The Devil's cock blocking me, I'm stuck on highway Sixty-One
You tell my Mum the only route for me is the risky one

Left or right is the question now
'Cause we're figuring our direction out
But really we're just like you
So we're taking you for the ride to
You wanna roll, come through
You wanna roll, come through

Some live along the river banks
Some live on the sea
Some 
Of the higher 
Some live in four walls
Some live underground
Some search for freedom
And some search just to be found


We don't know where we're going
We don't know where we're going
We don't know where we're going
We don't know where we're going
We don't know where we're going
We don't know where we're going
We don't know where we're going
