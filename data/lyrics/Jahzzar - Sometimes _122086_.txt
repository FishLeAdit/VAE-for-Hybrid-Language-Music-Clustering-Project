Sometimes I feel your love
Like a rose
In morning dew
Sometimes my heart is blue
Cause your love
Seems so untrue
Refrain:
So come on and take me
And shake me awake me
Cause life is just more than a dream
It's easy and sleasy
Feel teasy and freezy
Let's sailing along on that stream of love
Sometimes my soul feels free
Like a leaf
In a summerbreeze
Sometimes I fly away
With your love
Through night and day
Refrain:
So come on and take me
And shake me awake me
Cause life is just more than a dream
It's easy and sleasy
Feel teasy and freezy
Let's sailing along on that stream of love
Refrain...
