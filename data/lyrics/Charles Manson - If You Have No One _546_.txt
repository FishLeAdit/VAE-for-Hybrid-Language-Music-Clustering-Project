And if you have no-one
To set with, like me
All alone, all alone, I've always been
And I'll always be

Forever
In my soul
And the highways
Of the mind I can see

For I always and all in all and everything in all and everything I see
I'm mighty right on, now
Mighty right on, now
Mighty right on, right on, right on, right on, right on, now

I've been Georgia chaingang
Chattanooga, choo-choo
Chattanooga, choo-choo, Chattanooga-TC
Tennessee horse on down, around

Tennessee horse on down, around town
Tennessee horse on around, downtown in a
Wide open, all the way, zero
Wide open, all the way to Napa Valley, now

Born to fight, has tender grapes
Hey, up on that vine
Has tendеr grapes up on that wine
Rolling all the gatеs on home, now

Rolling in gates on home, now
Rolling gates on home around, around
Around, around, around, I'm
In your starlight

Motorola, Volvo
Motorola saw them walking him on, now
Got thirteen brothers, he's the Mac
Big Mac man in the back

Like a colonel with eagles on his shoulder
Eagles on his shoulder
Eagles on his shoulder, walking him on
Money, money, money, money, money, money

Money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money, ma
Money, money, ma-ma, ma-ma, m'ma-ma
Money ma-ma, ma-ma, m'money-ma

Sadey-rose-siday-dodo-do-di-do
Bad-rude-ol-ray
Ol' Dixie down
What can I say?

Oh, gone with the wind
And back in another day
I'm gone with the wind
Back on around again in another day

In another day
All the way, all the way
All the way, all the way
All the way, all the way
All the way, all the way
All the way, all the-
Way, All the way

Shi-je-j'juh-j'juh-juh-juh
Juh-da-da-da-doh
And Dixie on down, now
I'm Dixie on down, now

Dixie on, walking on
It's Dixie on down, now
I'm Dixie on down, around the highway

Upfon-dat-de-de-de-de-doowoo
Zat-do-do-do-do-do-do-day
Boom-boom-boom-budum-boom bum
De-dup do-dat-day

They're really quiet
Darkness keep rolling
Highway
Rolling my way
Rolling highway
On to the edge of town
