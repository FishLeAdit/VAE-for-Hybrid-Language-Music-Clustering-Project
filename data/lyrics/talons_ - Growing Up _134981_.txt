When you were a child and we all lived in the wild
And we married
And carried you in our arms and in our hearts
We were two, then three
Full and free just to be with you, see with you
Made us feel anew, just like every day, love you like today
It’s your birthday

Even though your mother’s suddenly crying
She says it is the cake in the kitchen, you know she’s lying
Your brother's fighting over your balloons
Still, the radio is playing all your favorite tunes
And Daddy is taking “Peter Pan” from the shelf
And he’ll read it out loud, though you could read it yourself
You’re growing up, you’re growing up
But don’t grow away from me
Oh, life is like a dream
The moment in between when you wake and sleep
In the deep, knowing it now, knowing how
It’s heavy though, we can help you grow
Wanna package up the world like a present
We fail, and try again
It's your birthday

I finally see
To let you go is the only way to really help you fly
But I’d rather hold on tight
You are a shining star
A bright spot in the universe
While things here go from bad to worse
So dark what lonely people do
Take too much, take too fast, eat too much
I wish there could be more of your kind
Grow strong, we’ll ride along
It’s your birthday
