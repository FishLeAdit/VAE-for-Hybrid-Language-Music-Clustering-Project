Cop this
Top problem is that probably no problem solved means your policy
Never dive deeper
Weak ears cause I popped 'em right after I fucked up your speakers
Better call the hospital
I just seen a treble stab Rick Rab, damn it’s a suicide
Nah, scratch that it’s a homicide
Vulture with a mohawk slamming at your promenade
I'm just rapping like a vertebrae axe
Backpack chock full of vertebrae snacks (ah!)
Yeah, so carry on little carrion
Your rat race gets my silver screen gas face
And you're up chatter box, put some lazy brain
Men’ll slow down I explain like I'm Frasier Crane (Cheers!)
You're a clown with no claws
And I'll make you bust a mean Jackson Pollock in your drawers

Everybody likes to touch somebody sometimes
Not everybody can touch me though, y'know?

You’re not original, stupid, don’t get duped, all you duplicates
Suicide chic, here’s a brand new noose to get
I rock a beard and you don’t like my style, what?! (Excuse me!)
Looking at your hundred dollar clothes, where’d you get those?
Is that the total for your shit or your zip code?
Sorry, but the feeling won’t last
And I rock those for free when I steal them from your trash (what!)
I got misplaced anger don’t push and
When I say fuck you I really mean fuck George Bush
Yeah, and it's not just me
I'm cooler than my backyard in blizzard '03 (what?!)
And I'm cooler than some rabies funk
And I'm thumping like elephants humping in your trunk, yeah
And I'm cooler than some rabies funk
And I'm thumping like elephants humping in your trunk
