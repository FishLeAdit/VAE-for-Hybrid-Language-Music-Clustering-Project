Pale and silent sister, ever by my side
Behind the thinnest veil
Behind the thinnest veil
Your smile is calm, calm
And not so cold
No blame
No blame
Cruel sister when you call my name
My time
My time
Cruel sister when the hour is mine
Arm in arm I'll walk with you
I already do
Pale and silent sister, ever by my side
Behind the thinnest veil
Behind the thinnest vеil
Your smile is calm, calm
And not so cold
No blame
No blame
Cruеl sister when you call my name
My time
My time
Cruel sister when the hour is mine
Arm in arm I'll walk with you
I already do
Pale and silent sister, ever by my side
Behind the thinnest veil
Behind the thinnest veil
Your smile is calm, calm
And not so cold
No blame
No blame
Cruel sister when you call my name
My time
My time
Cruel sister when the hour is mine
Arm in arm I'll walk with you
I already do
