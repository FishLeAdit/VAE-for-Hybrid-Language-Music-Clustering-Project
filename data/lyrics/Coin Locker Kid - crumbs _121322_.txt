Even when the love's gone I tell my baby put her kiddy gloves on lace em tight whether you may call it torch or flashlight gaslamp the bedbugs bite the rug is damp
King rat camps underneath the floorboard the warlord's old as four scored and I'm scarred and I'm barred from the festival
To kidnap the lineage and make a mess of it
I listen to Nietzsche
I listen to him 'cuz my mother's dead body can't beseech me
Hartman, you are not my father
The critic is not an analyst
And recognize
I represent the Katalyst
--
No flesh no bone ear to the grindstone waiting on the torrent for Melancholia bring it on home if you got the bootleg from Sweden baby I'm a lie and your egg is bleeding
I'm not the one
And you're cumming with the setting of the sun
And you wait beneath the stars
For the devil
To wash upon
With a message in a bottle
Just to pass the broke glass
Just to use it as a model
Some say
"The world is so flat you can fold it like a centrefold and shove it in your top-hat!"
Stop that complaining, 'cuz some way
"Everyone is sure to find the truth one day!"
And I don't believe the world is dictated by my organs;
The world physical (you shouldn't take it literal.)
This pagan god's gift is lyrical
And that's how I arrange bodies
(Even when we change bodies.)

You're such a wonderful person!
But you got problems!
Oh let me touch you!
Let me touch you!
Oh!
