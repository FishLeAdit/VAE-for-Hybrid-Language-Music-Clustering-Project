I take off my clothes
Letting you touch me
Receiving every bit
Receiving every bit
(Chorus)
Make me smile
I can make you smile
How come you make me smile?
You hide behind clothes
Letting myself be taken in by your promises
Naked, a fool, I get dressed again
Trying to forget that I, I showed you my skin
(Chorus)
Make me smile
I can make you smile
How come you make me smile?
