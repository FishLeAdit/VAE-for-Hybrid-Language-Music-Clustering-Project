You and me against the world
Runnin’ thru the jungle

Don’t hide from what you feel in your heart
Cause I know who you really are
And you can’t run away from the truth that’s inside you
No, you don’t have to be afraid
Give your soul and dreams away
Cause no matter what you do, I’ll be here for you
Stronger together, stronger together

I wanna go, wanna go with you
Runnin’ thru the jungle if you want me to
Doesn’t really matter what we’re goin’ thru
As long as we’re together runnin’ thru the jungle

True, I’ll be likе Tarzan to your Jane
I’ll satisfy you every way
And you’ll nеver have to know what it’s like to be lonely
No, you don’t have to be afraid
Give your soul and dreams away
Cause no matter what you do, I’ll be here for you
Stronger together, stronger together

I wanna go, wanna go with you
Runnin’ thru the jungle if you want me to
Doesn’t really matter what we’re goin’ thru
As long as we’re together runnin’ thru the jungle

Free to be who you want to be, room to breathe
You and me against the world
Free to dream every possibility, room to breathe
Together we can do it, do it girl

I wanna go, wanna go with you
Runnin’ thru the jungle if you want me to
Doesn’t really matter what we’re goin’ thru
As long as we’re together runnin’ thru the jungle
