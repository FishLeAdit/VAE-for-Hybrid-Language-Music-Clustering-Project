Stupid is as stupid does, and Lester's done it all
We can't afford to just ignore the writing on the wall
Thin the herds and purge the group
Yeah, leave behind that nincompoop
Lester is a dimwit and I've known my share of fools
He's bringing down the system and he's breaking all the rules
Thin the herds and purge the group
Yeah, leave behind that nincompoop
And watch him roam away
The decision here is hard, but all the same it must be done
The necessity of the many far outweighs the needs of one
Thin the herds and purge the group
Yeah, leave behind that nincompoop
Lester, we must thank you but for now it's our farewell
We wish you all the best when you are burning down in hell
Thin the herds and purge the group
Go to hell, you nincompoop
And we watch him burn away
