I remember when
We used to stay all nice in time
While our people getting high
We would cry
And just to get by
Had to turn to the life of crime
To survive uh

I remember when
We used to stay all nice in time

And just tho get by
Had to turn to the life of crime

D, I miss you more than ever
Despite the pain
Still it's hard to put it all together
Your life was claimed
Feels like a dream
Never thought you'd be the first to go
Never felt your pain
Cause you kept your life so personal and even though you gone
We overwhelmed you man, with love
Mike he was a newborn
Never let him stay outside too late or even too long
Can't never understand the pain we felt to have to move on
And everybody miss you even Caifa
And I cruise on
To see you dying was wrong
It's what I can type from niggas live long
I'm moving like them
So when the night come
I eat, sleep and grieving since
Still get right from weed
And a sip from gin
You know the life man
It's on until we meet again
And 'though you gone
'n my heart I keep you deep within
And can't a night go by
Without us wondering why
You had to die
It brings tears to my eyes uh

I remember when
We used to stay all nice in time
While our people getting high

And just tho get by
Had to turn to the life of crime

We would cry
And just tho get by
Had to turn to the life of crime

Seems like yesterday we had to talk about
Prada and Gucci
And how we used to boost things and
Take them back to 2C
How you snuk in new trees
And new V's
How you always stayed dip
With new kicks and new jeans
She was the shit
In New Queens
Better than most snakers who had whip
Stacking crazy chips back in '86
My cousin/little sis
(?) was glad to see how they're getting money
Fuck with people
Said we had to eat so we can live
So we can have a decent crib
We played the streets
To survive and try to treat the kids
Instead the street had no time to
See no bit(???)
Though it was deeper
(All) we could do was drive (?)
You know the streets
Now we speak about you everyday
While blowing trees
And laugh at shit you'd always say
Me, you and D know what we has to do to get this cake
You left the team and was a player
No one can replace
We love you D, we miss you

Wish we could go back in time
And rewind your life
And bring it back to the beggining
When you was little and winston
Called you stinkin'
I was living in the projects
And see you on the weekend
You fell of your bike
I road over you(?)(or "I woul' run over to you" but said faster)
And you were screaming
It wasn't like I was tryna make you suffer, bleeding (?)
Cuz we was tight
Even then we had it rough
Now we're grieving your life
Can't believe you tried the stuff
That had you feening all night
I still hold your love
Cuz you was queen in my eyes
And we know you keep in touch
Trough our dreams every night
You provide us and guide us
Against strife
Living life with pride
You survived over 10 fights
Just to see you die
Getting high
Hurt me 10 times as much
Wish I could blow with
Dust in your name
And get you talking the pain
Cuz you know ain't nothing the same
Without you D, we miss you
