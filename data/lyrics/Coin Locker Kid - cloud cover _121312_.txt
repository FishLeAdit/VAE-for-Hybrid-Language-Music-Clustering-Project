It covers the eyes
It's washed in the gutter and dies
And it's staring at the virgin like she hypnotizes
With red lips, and full of surprises
Sick of waiting and her slow demise is
Premeditating sewing up her eyelids
Hope I didn't tell you something that you knew already
When I got the needle, my hands are steady
I'm like a surgeon with the shears and the thread in the attic
Injecting the anesthetic 'til you're dead in the attic
And numb
It's biting the tongue
It's losing 'em in the cracks, and collapsing the lungs
--
Someone. Someone. Someone. Someone
Someone
Is making me undone
Who knows wherever they come from?
In the country?
When the cows come back
I was opening my eyes, and my hands were black
And I was opening my eyes and my hands were black
I was (???) the puddles (???) the placemat
The rat saves face
The rat saves face. Everybody falls, and it's far from grace
Most times around it gets wasted
Strange fruit but it don't get tasted
Which is all good with me;
I was stitching up and hanging from the poplar tree
Which should be enough
