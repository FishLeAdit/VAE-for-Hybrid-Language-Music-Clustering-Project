V1
You can see the look in my eye
Ainít gonna stop anytime soon
Wrote a whole new book while I cry
Me and my team all flowers set to bloom
Canít stop till we reach the sky
We the type to lay on the cloud
Sing to the moon
Meet the sun real soon
Our thunder, bout to boom
Hook
Dancing with Lightning
For some may seem frightening
We find it exciting
To dance in the lightning

V2
Light strikes
Darkness ignites
Karma bites
New days new nights
Take action, seek sight
We are gonna win this fight
Ill die for the wrong to get right
And you better believe that everybody gonna be alright
Hook
V3
The suns fire pounds in the heart
Every target hit with our love dart
Measure this we above chart
Treasure this we can win smart
Not average, see we invent
Unsavage with our intent
Rain falls, wash away
Owls call, better prepare in the lair for a whole new day
Hook
V4
And when you feel it, donít conceal it
Scream in bliss you are it
Piece of god and goddess
Seek calm amidst fits
Realize the cosmic trick
We are bread as slaves in a prism
Open your mind to the system
We all been dead and spinnin
Get our the box of this prison
Ainít no body got time for you to just sit there wishin
Dancing with Lightning, I am
Dancing with Lightning, you are
Dancing with Lightning, we are
Dancing, Dancing, Dancing

Outro
Lets frequency match, are you you into that
Read my mind for the past, I recreated new facts
Can you feel my pulse my bodies your map
Let go of whats false, next your cocoon we could wrap
