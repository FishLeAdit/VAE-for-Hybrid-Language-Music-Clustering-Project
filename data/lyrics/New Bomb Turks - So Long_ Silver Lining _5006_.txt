It's pushing too hard, it's pushing too soft
No silver lining, the rain pouring down
Raincoat pushing my feet over ground
Street lights dimming, sights sinking down
Watch the good times bottom out
Where's that silver lining?
Sweet liberty done got sour
Hear that bell? Midnight hour
Sorrow lies waiting like a lucky black cat
It's me that I'm hating, how about that?
Watch the good times bottom out
Where's that silver lining?
Watch the dark clouds pile up
So long silver lining
Tomorrow's just another day
Your last one to your hand
The same old answer to the same question
Nothing to do, man
Lady Luck's a hermaphrodite and I was a virgin
This time I got fucked right or wrong I ain't certain
When you're trying to clean house, don't spare the tears
Silver lining busts and rusts through the years
Watch the good times bottom out
Where's that silver lining?
Watch the dark clouds pile up
So long silver lining
