Quickly forgetting was the way I lived my life
Try telling me your name or try telling me "don't worry."
Everything I knew would quickly wither and die
And all echoes would be buried in the sound of living
The sound of my feet on the sidewalk
That was me - treasure hunting, I would bury what I found
That was me - the gold digger, underground

Quickly forgotten was that forgetful way of life
When I left home, when I lived as if I'd died
Sitting on a rock and doing nothing
Alone for so long, in the dark I found my sight
And there your name was written large in letters bright!
There my faith was! "Worry not!" declared the night
In the great void of my life I could feel the shape of what was missing
Like the way the Woolly Mammoth stands so tall and bold in our minds
I was shaken at the size of my cry
And the true love it described

I know day is dawning now, so ends my holy night
It's back to the world I go, back to the girls and shows
And other worldly woes, and their unfurling flows
Will I carry myself slowly enough to remember?
I sit on a dark rock doing nothing still, just crowded
And there's the love in flesh and bone
