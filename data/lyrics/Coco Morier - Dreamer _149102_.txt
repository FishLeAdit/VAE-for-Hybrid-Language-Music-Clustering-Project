I don’t care if I’m a dreamer
Promise the moon and I’ll believe ya
No I don’t care if I’m a dreamer
I want to fall a little deeper

It’s my reckless heart that makes me fall in love with you again
And it’s my wildest dream that has me chasing after you again
And I love and I love and I love you more
I don’t care, I don’t care if I lose it all
And I love and I love and I love you more oh, oh
And I love and I love and I love you more
I don’t care, I don’t care if I lose it all
And I love and I love and I love you more oh, oh

I don’t care if I’m a dreamer
You are the secret, I’m the keeper
Yeah they all say that I’m a dreamer
I live in clouds, I love the rainstorms

It’s my reckless heart that makes me fall in love with you again
And it’s my wildest dream that has me chasing after you again
And I love and I love and I love you more
I don’t care, I don’t care if I lose it all
And I love and I love and I love you more oh, oh
And I love and I love and I love you more
I don’t care, I don’t care if I lose it all
And I love and I love and I love you more oh, oh

I don’t care if I’m a dreamer
They all say that I’m a dreamer

It’s my reckless heart that makes me fall in love with you again
And it’s my wildest dream that has me chasing after you again
And I love and I love and I love you more
I don’t care, I don’t care if I lose it all
And I love and I love and I love you more oh, oh
And I love and I love and I love you more
I don’t care, I don’t care if I lose it all
And I love and I love and I love you more oh, oh

I don’t care if I’m a dreamer
