Mother, there's a side to me you don't know
Different to the child with the smile in your photos
Made some decisions, some wrong, some right
Now strangers call my number when I'm sleeping at night
But they're sinners too
And they'll only make me worse
Don't let me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in a road

Like a fallen angel
I seek refuge in the valley of lonesome souls
With tales told of those taken from those of broken homes
I smoke the chung while my heart bleeds burgundy
Stuck on the title page, still yearning to turn the sheet
Observing the worst deceit
This book of lies got me shook of life
Still picturing crooked ties
I must've mistook for right
Getting nicked again and again
Whether the venom is peng
It severs several levels in head
But for some reason, I'm several levels ahead of these
Sheep and cattle, wannabes, wannabe street and battle
But many die in war, that's a fact
In the pursuit of glory, men will attack intact no looking back
Bang!
That's the sound of the cell door slam
In this hell is where they wanna dwell more, man
Criminal antics with villains that bang clips in nang whips
No bank slips just banquets with so much food!

Mother, there's a side to me you don't know
Different to the child with the smile in your photo
Made some decisions, some wrong, some right
Now strangers call my number when I'm sleeping at night
But they're sinners too
And they'll only make me worse
Don't let me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in a road

Bumped into the devil up at the crossroads
Searching for lost souls
Picking them up in bulk like Costco's
And whoever's written my life movie
Done gave me some plot holes
But made me sharp enough so I clocked those
The times it was too late
The penny just dropped slow
People are scared when they shoot the sheriff
But not when they shot Os
And that's how far you go
To cop those designer jeans
And it's a no-brainer when you got these mindless needs
You mix in the anger inside these teens
With no parental guidance in the script
All you'll get is violent scenes
In the community
Want them to hear opportunity knock
They can't even see the opportunity
Ain't got the eyes for it
But got the hunger into destruction, they might pour it
They can't afford the cost but who's paying the price for it
And is it all worth it
Cause at the end of day, nobody's all perfect

Mother, there's a side to me you don't know
Different to the child with the smile in your photos
Made some decisions, some wrong, some right
Now strangers call my number when I'm sleeping at night
But they're sinners too
And they'll only make me worse
Don't let (don't let) me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in a road

But they're sinners too
But they're sinners too
But they're sinners too
But they're sinners too
