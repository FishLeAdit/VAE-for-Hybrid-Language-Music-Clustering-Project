We sit in the grass and we talk of our pasts
A roll call of all our lovers
A feeling arises we both recognize
We could fulfill each other
What if we do?
We each have travelled and come to a rest
We're trying to make things happen
Neither of us know how to measure success
Hey, we could fall in love and be happy
What if we do?
All the butterflies rise to the surface
I say stupid things when I get nervous
Watch the sunset, forget all the chatter
All the butterflies say it don't matter
It's getting late. We had better head back
We could stop and get some dinner
There's a full moon rising, the stars are aligned
We could spend the night together
What if we do?
