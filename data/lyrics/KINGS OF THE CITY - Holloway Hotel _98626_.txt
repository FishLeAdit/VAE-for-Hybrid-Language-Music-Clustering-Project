I said the judge gave you four years
And it was all tears
Wish I could say you showed no fear, but you did
Lookin' at your kids
Now Mum's sorry
A look of worry and woe was on show but no
Your man of seven years didn't stick around
But I don't blame him or hate him
That's just the way that shit goes down now

I said they took my Momma away
I guess life can turn in a horrible way

Some go in for 
Some go in for good
Some go in for something
No one ever understood
Some come out and find the bar
Some come out a shame
But if you go in good
And leave the same
Don't let it change your name

I know you're listening right now
Alone
Tell me about that first night
I'm glad you held your own
In your new home
A psychopathic lunatics roam
You made a couple friends too
Just the same as you
Made some mistakes
But mistakes is what makes us true
But they're sinners too
Danny done told you that
So just watch your back
I'll send a letter for a chat
And try relax as I look after my siblings
'Cause being an honourable son's
Been written in my life mission
I'm missin' you like the desert misses rain
And it isn't the same but it switches my brain
Into focus mode
'Cause it is from when they get it
If I been sober loads
I hope you take notice so
I dedicate the next few years to makin' you proud
And to say thank you for all the times that 
I say they took my Momma away I guess

Don't let it change your name

Yeah
You know you're in our thoughts
Pray every night for you
That time is takin' off
And that it flies for you
This ain't goodbye it's just goodnight
So rest your head I know you might
Not see the light but trust me
Your Son's gonna rise for you
Await the new dawn
Every sunset means a new morn
Every old life was a new born
If it's worthy, what I learnt is
Every journey brings a few storms
Don't ever look back
Or lose that free spirit
Remember
They never took that
