Every beast I chased led me down a path
Lined with waste from a quiet past
And all the faces there, though they are few
Have borne new lines, they are older too

And every word I wrote stumbled down
To the paper, thin and barely bound
Road I lit to see the eyes
Of my long lost friends, the ones I recognize


And where are they? Spread far around
Not likе my dreams, so closely bound
Yet hеre we are in the mountain's eye
Just a couple of kids holding tight
