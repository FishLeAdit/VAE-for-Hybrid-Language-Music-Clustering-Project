Sister calling
Pictures falling
Onto the hardwood
Pieces of pleasant times
Recall the second
Gather what remains
Until you run out
Visions come undone
When you’re growing up, everybody's a stranger to you
In your age it shows about who you know
Moving around, no longer live together
In the summer house where dandelions grow
Foggy places
Distant faces
Reminiscent
Sitting on porches
Can it be true
10 years spilled over?
Incandescent
Memories glisten
When you’re growing up, everybody's a stranger to you
In your age it shows about who you know
Moving around, no longer live together
In the summer house where dandelions grow
