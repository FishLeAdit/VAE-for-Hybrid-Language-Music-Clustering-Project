Every morning - endless falling
You say my name, but each time is not the same
The pillow talk is getting boring
I wouldn't play your game
So forget it, go away
Twisted Head is full of nothing
What can you say?
We got the overdose again 
Shut 'em up, it's time for lovers
You can't deny, our time is over
But I feel young until the end
Twisted Head is full of nothing
What can you say?
We got the overdose again 
Now we fall asleep for thousand hours
Everything's dead
We got the overdose again
