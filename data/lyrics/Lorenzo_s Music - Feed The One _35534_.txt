Come unglued someway
Come on calm, as to convey
Even fine, ever fair
Wait and then they'll see
Then they'll find
Then they'll know
Then they'll see
Then they'll find
Then they'll know
And to feed the one, again
To feed the one, again
Down letter, phone rang
Kinda got a roll a vote of no
Found under pressure
Gotta go, gotta go
Then they'll see
Then they'll find
Then they'll know
Then they'll see
Then they'll find
Then they'll know
And to feed the one, again
To feed the one, again
