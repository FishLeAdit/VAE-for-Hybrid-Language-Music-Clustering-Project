Nothing to do but sit with the doubt
Watching the clouds and the weather
Since you've been gone you know it's been a little hard
But at last I got my loneliness together
I pretend to myself that I'm much better off
No one to make me waste my time
And if I'm feeling down there's only me to blame
It's me that's on the end of the line
Maybe it's as well that I part such a thought
For ages I had nothing new to show you
But now I see your memory making love in some hotel
But when I recollect I didn't know you
Sometimes in the night I take a lazy walk
To the tree where we made our first confession
Of love and of permanence and other vicious lies
All the things that now need no impression
Rewind
I've nothing to do but sit with the doubt
Watching the clouds and the weather
Since you've been gone you know it's been a little hard
But at last I got my loneliness together
