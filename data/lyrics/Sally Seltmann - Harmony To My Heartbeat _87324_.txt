Dreams, they come and go
This is one that I've had forever, I know
Been crossing my fingers and always hoping
For it to come true
Waiting for the train
I can see your face in the distance again
Got a little dream that's become a friend
And a reality

And I'm running just as fast as I can to tell you the news
We can do this together, we can, yeah, me and you

When you hold me I can see
This is exactly where I wanna be
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby

Dreams, they come and go
But I just kept doing what I loved even though
All I ever wished for was out of breath
Running so slow
I found the lock and the key
Now I can be everything I've wanted to be
Got a little dream that's become a friend
For the melody

And I'm running just as fast as I can to tell you the news
We can do this together, we can, yeah, me and you

When you hold me I can see
This is exactly where I wanna be
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby

Harmony to my heartbeat, baby
Harmony to my heartbeat, baby

When you hold me I can see
This is exactly where I wanna be
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby

Harmony to my heartbeat, baby
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby
Harmony to my heartbeat, baby
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby
Harmony to my heartbeat, baby
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby
Harmony to my heartbeat, baby
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby
Harmony to my heartbeat, baby
You're the harmony to my heartbeat

When you hold me I can see
This is exactly where I wanna be
You're the harmony to my heartbeat, baby
