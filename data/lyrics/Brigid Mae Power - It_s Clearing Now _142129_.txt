The roll of a-a-a-a-a-a-a...
The roll of a wave
It's enough to make me stay
And abandon all my dreams
Live here forever with you and the sea

But it's clearing, clearing now
It's clearing, clearing now

My romantic mind
It is always trying to decide
Oh many, many times, to force happiness
I have tried but I had to be patient
In waiting for it's movement

But it's clearing, clearing now
It's clearing, clearing now

The movement of you
Has opened me to truth
Tr-u-u-u-u...

The seaweed on the beach
The sun falling down over the sea
I'd cling to these beautiful things
Immerse myself in their feelings

But it's clearing, clearing now
It's clearing, clearing now

I have some peace inside of me
I don't need it so much now in other things
Oh...
