Kiss me, I'm drunk
And I think that I love you baby
Kiss me, I'm drunk
And hold my hand
If you're scared or concerned for your health
Just pretend that I'm someone else
Kiss me, I'm drunk
Kiss me, I'm drunk
I'll love you 'til my dying days
Or until they kick us out of this place
I'll be your oyster if you be my pearl
Come on not a care in the world
For a boy or a girl
Kiss me, I'm drunk
Can I take just a piece of your time
Kiss me, I'm drunk
Let me be your man
I've got a plan for us honey
If you think you can loan me the money
Kiss me, I'm drunk
Kiss me, I'm drunk
Come on let's get out of this place
I've got a room mate but he just bought a case
Won't let my love for you be unsung
Remember the time we were young
When a tongue was a tongue
I'll love you 'til my dying days
Or at least until my memory fades
Imagine that we're lovers enthralled
When I've got you pinned to the wall
In the last bathroom stall
Kiss me, I'm drunk
Kiss me, I'm drunk
Kiss me, I'm drunk
Kiss me, I'm drunk
Baby I'm alive but I'm not awake
Baby I'm alive but I'm not okay
I'm alive but I'm not awake
Baby I'm alive but I'm not okay
Kiss me, I'm drunk
Kiss me, I'm drunk
Kiss me, I'm drunk
Kiss me, I'm
Kiss me, I'm drunk
