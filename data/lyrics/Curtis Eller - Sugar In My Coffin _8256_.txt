They're putting water in the whisky just to keep the boys in line
You ain't busting up my place like you did last time
The drinks are getting weaker with every round they serve
The way they keep us sober is getting on my nerves
So when I'm dead and gone, I want some sugar in my coffin
If I goatta go, I want some sugar in my coffin
Oh no there ain't no Elvis Presley from the waist down
Or else I ain't learned nothin' from T.V
He's shaking like an animal, point that camera where I said
We need this white boy going crazy like a hole in the head
So when I'm dead and gone, I want some sugar in my coffin
If I goatta go, I want some sugar in my coffin
I want sugar in my coffin, I wanna cut the bitter taste
But they hide it in your money and there's cameras everyplace
I been living with it just about as long as I can face
So if I goatta go...
I want some sugar in my coffin
I want some sugar in my coffin
Well I heard about the seance in the Whitehouse yesterday
Has President Lincoln lost his mind?
They caught him in the graveyard diggin' in the mud
That's the father of our nation with a sickness in his blood
So won't you listen to me mister, I want some sugar in my coffin
If I really goatta go, I want some sugar in my coffin
I want sugar in my coffin, I wanna cut the bitter taste
But the President's a liar the country's fallen in disgrace
If they're ever coming clean they ainn't got no time to waste
So if I goatta go...
I want some sugar in my coffin
I want some sugar in my coffin
I want some sugar mister...I want some sugar mister...
I want some sugar in my coffin
