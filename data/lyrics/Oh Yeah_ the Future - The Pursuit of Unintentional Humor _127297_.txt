I touted my proudest thoughts, unabashedly uncool
I sang a song of snot and played myself for a fool
Cracked my chest to let my heart's vast ignorance shine through
Regaled all my dreamy brain farts as if they'd already come true

I scattered the straightest thoughts
Shouted the sweetest tunes
I footed the stiffest costs
And suffered the stupidest wounds

While practicing the pratfall from my hubris hot air balloon
The rushing of endorphins made me forget it wasn't true

The pursuit of unintentional humor
Has worn me to the bone
You had to be there
I guess you just had to be there

I met a sweet young woman whose heart I longed to woo
She shattered my perceptions with a snap, and off they flew

My love was so enormous
It obscured the world from view
And I was sure it was all over
When she said she loved me too

But I fell back on old habits before I realized I knew
And in the course of making fun of it, I forgot my love was true

The pursuit of unintentional humor
Has worn me to the bone
You had to be there
I guess you had to be there, oh-oh

The difficulty of this maneuver
Is moot over the telephone
You had to be there
I guess you just had to be there

And I want you all to know
I'm not ashamed of it, not a bit
And I'll not apologize
Not in the middle of a game you can only win by
Believing your own bullshit
'Cause I'm on the warpath to unintentional humor
I'm on the expressway to irrelevance

Unintentional humor--have I achieved it at last?
Unintentional humor--is it a thing of the past?
Unintentional humor--so shallow, so vast
Unintentional humor--what a pain in the ass

The pursuit of unintentional humor
Has worn me to the bone
You had to be there
I guess you just had to be there
Oh, you had to be there
Oh, you really had to be there
