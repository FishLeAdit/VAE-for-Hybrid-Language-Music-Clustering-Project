In a suburban desert
A fast food high
We swipe at peeling paint
Swat away flies
The crawling milk-fed
Squawking cream-filled
Hominids
Ids
Immune to broken
To wasted time
To bolts of lightning
Bungee together
Your body's guards
The bloodiest bond
Blacking out the dark
The darkest flame
The darkest waltz
A sunburnt snarl
Thrashing and parched
A singular desire
To drive into the dirt
No lust, no gluttony
We're free as algae
In a suburban desert
A fast food high
We swipe at peeling paint
Swat away flies
The crawling milk-fed
Squawking cream-filled
Hominids
Ids
Immune to broken
To naked shame
To bolts of lightning
To broken flame
To broken waltz
To sunburnt snarls
Thrashing and parched
A singular desire
To drive into the dirt
No lust, no gluttony
We're free as algae
Those with an all-consuming passion in lockstep
