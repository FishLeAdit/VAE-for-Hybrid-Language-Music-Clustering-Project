Temper temper on it goes
When they tell you off and tell you no

Because you went outside
And now you wanna go home
No you went two miles
And Now you don't know
But John, don't you pretend
That you don't know
:
Hold your hand out while you can
Because there's nothing in it is there man?

Because you went outside
And now you wanna go home
No you went two miles
And now you don't know
But John, don't you pretend
That you don't know
