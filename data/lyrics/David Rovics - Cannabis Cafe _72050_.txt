I wish I was up in Vancouver
At the Cannabis Cafe
Smoking good old sensemelia
At the beginning of the day
But here I am in New York City
Hiding out in Central Park
Getting kidnapped by the police
Today sometime before dark
But I wish I was up in Vancouver...
The judge looked down upon me, frowing
He said, "kid, get on your way
"Just don't start out your morning
"With espresso and a j"
I said I wish I was up in Vancouver...
I hitched a ride out to Portland
Caught one up to B.C
Took a bus over to Hastings Street
To have a bowl with my coffee
Now I'm up in Vancouver...
