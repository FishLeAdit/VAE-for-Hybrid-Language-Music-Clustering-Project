You said I've changed
I said "I hope so"
And quietly sighed
There was a silence
You looked pained
I kinda liked it, all the same

I feel beat down, broken most of the time
But you make me feel like I’m alive
You speak a language just for you and me
I think I'm learning how to be happy

You said, "I barely recognize you"
I said, "That was the point"
Under my breath
We traded stories
You looked vacant
It wasn't boring, it doesn’t have to be

I feel like all I do is waste your timе
Grab my hands and try to find my eyes
You make a jokе specifically for me
I think I'm learning how to be happy

You are so precious to me
A perfect example of how I'd like to be
I learn from you, just being near you
It's never boring
It never was
