Well it seems to me that you're nice to me
Until I have a girl 'round my arms
Then you come up and say I wasn't yours anyways
Showing off your little charms
Yeah
Yeah

Not as pretty
As I thought you were
Not as pretty
No more, no more
Well you were always looking for the greener grass
But I ain't looking, looking back

See your smile for someone new
It don't do what it used to
And one million miles, but all the while
You have barely moved
Yeah
Yeah

Not as pretty
As I thought you were
Not as pretty
No more, no more
Well you were always looking for the greener grass
But I ain't looking, looking back


Not as pretty
As I thought you were
Not as pretty
No, No more, no more
Well you were always looking for the greener grass
But I ain't looking, looking back
