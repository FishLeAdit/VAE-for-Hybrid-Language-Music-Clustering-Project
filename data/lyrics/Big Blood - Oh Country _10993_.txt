Oh, country, you bloody old miser
Shake off the ancient dust of your heartless fathers
And rain pounds upon Tyne upon Tweed upon the daylight
Darlings sweating to keep you upright

How I love to leave you crooning your songs
Mooning away the time to stretch farther
While he chased the lovely tails of youth turned soft and holy
Makes loose the leashes and lashes of this cracked armor

All skin and bones and no home
Born alone, only to end me alone
All skin and bones and no home

Your words digest space cruising red hot swollen lines
Tight nights awake pushing forth
Bring me blue, answering lashes and eyes we grow long
Hard limbs protecting our colors from each other burned hollow

All skin and bones and no home
Born alone only to end me alone
All skin and bones and no home
All skin and bones and nowhere to go
