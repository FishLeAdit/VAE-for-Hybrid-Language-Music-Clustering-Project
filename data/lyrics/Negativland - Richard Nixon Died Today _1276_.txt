If you'll join us in this song
I think you'll recognize it when I start it
Let me get a chord-
One, two, three, four
Always remember:
Others may hate you
But those who hate you don't win
Unless you hate them
And then, you destroy yourself

Richard Nixon died today
That's just plain poppycock
And then, you destroy yourself
I saw it on the news, they said
Au revoir. Au revoir. We'll see you again

Oh, I guess he was okay
Well, I am not a crook
He was the president everybody hated
Because pеople have got to know
Whethеr or not their president is a crook
Their president is a crook
But I am not a crook
Crook, crook

And I don't dream about the president anymore
Crook, crook, as a flower she grew
And all of my friends, they say that they don't either
Crook, crook, and as a fair young flower, she died

Richard Nixon died today (Poppycock)
I saw it on the news, they said (Because people have gotta know)
Oh, I guess he was okay (Their president's a crook)
I'm watching history remade (crook, crook)

He went to a special place in heaven (I have never obstructed justice)
Called Yorba Linda
(We don't have a good, um... word for it in English
Poppycock)

And I don't dream about the President anymore
Crook crook, as a flower she grew
And most of my friends, they say that they don't either
And as a fair young flower, she died

Richard Nixon died today
That's just plain poppycock. We'll see you again
Richard Nixon died today
We'll see you again. We'll see you again
Au revoir. Au revoir
