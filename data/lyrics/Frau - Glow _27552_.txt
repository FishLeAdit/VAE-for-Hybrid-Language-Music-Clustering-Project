Hold me, you shall never ever see me
Blankets  will not hesitate me
Flowers  shant even wake
Kiss me, this the last time you may see me
This the last time light shall harm me
I  shall cry myself to death
Funny,  how you never showed your love to me
Lovely, oh the lights I can see
It  is gleaming in my eyes like when you
Burned me, tear my skin off and leave me
This the last time you may hold me
This the last time I shall say good bye
