Well, you left home the other night
I won't see you for a couple days
But I still leave on all the lights
And all your stuff is still in place
Where you left it

You turned me into a wreck
I swear I hear you coming through that door
But every time I go to check
You're not there and I swear not to fall for that no more

Oh my God, could this be?
Is love finally tripping me?
I'm falling for you
And if I die before I wake
The dreams of you were my escape
I'm falling for you

A TV lights an empty room
That shines upon me laying in my bed
As every memory of you
All night long since you've been gone is running through my head

Oh my God, could this be?
Is love finally tripping me?
I'm falling for you
And if I die before I wake
The dreams of you were my escape
I'm falling for you

Oh, I am so behind
Every single thought of you is ever-running through my mind
Oh, I am so behind
Every single thought of you is ever-running through my mind
Through my mind, and I say

Oh my God, could this be?
Is love finally tripping me?
I'm falling for you
And if I die before I wake
The dreams of you were my escape
I'm falling for you

Oh my God, could this be?
Is love finally tripping me?
I'm falling for you
For you
For you
