Requested everybody stays calm in the current moment
For there is a zombie apocalypse currently happening on the West Coast
Do stay inside, do not go out under any circumstances
If any zombies happen to enter into your house
Shoot them in the head or remove the head from the brain
(Oh, hey!)

I don't want to go home today
You don't really want to just go
The blue skies are telling me to go that way, yeah-eh-eh
I think I might just fly away
And leave all my things behind (Yeah-eh-eh)
I think I might just leave the world
And go run into my mind (Oh, hey!)

Little blue flower
Sing a little louder
Get me little higher
So I can just dance with you (Oh hey!)
Little blue flower (Hey!)
Sing a little louder (Hey!)
Get me little higher
So I can just dance with you

Ooh-ooh
