I built this house but it fell down before I got one night of sleep
So how does that beat all the fools who never tried
They missed the moon in rented rooms,
traded stories over food
I worked alone, broke my bones with all my pride
I desired royal attire, so I acquired the emperor's skin
held a parade and begged the world to look inside
I wanted fame, 'cause I thought fame could prove to me that I was great
it never came; I was a failure to myself
It's the way of the world to swallow you alive
The way of the world to swallow you alive
spirit first
It's been so long singing songs I couldn't possibly still mean
i guess they're lies if they've lost the truth they had
and it's so hard to get well, writing postcards home from Hell
I'd rather pack; I'd rather leave this all
It's the way of the world to swallow you alive
the way of the world to swallow you alive
spirit first
Whoa, Whoa
I give up
Whoa, Whoa
I give up
You get one life  and I spend mine chasing highways made of ghosts
now I don't know the way home from where I stand
And I believed I was free till I forgot what I believed
now I don't even need chains to hold me down
