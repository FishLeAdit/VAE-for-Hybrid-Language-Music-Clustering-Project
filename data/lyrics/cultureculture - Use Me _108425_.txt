I never knew how much your love could bring me down
But now I see, you're runnin' over me

Take my heart and throw it on the ground
You take my love and spread it all around
Give me one more reason to stay, baby
I tried my best to give it all to you
There's not a thing in the world I wouldn't do for you
Just give me one more reason to stay, baby

Do you remember, remember just what you said to me?
When we were lovers, just lovin' like it's a fantasy
I never knew how much your love could bring me down
But now I see, you're runnin' over me

Take my heart and throw it on the ground
You take my love and spread it all around
Give me one more reason to stay, baby
I tried my best to give it all to you
There's not a thing in the world I wouldn't do for you
Just give me one more reason to stay, baby


Take my heart and throw it on the ground
You take my love and spread it all around
Give me one more reason to stay, baby
I tried my best to give it all to you
There's not a thing in the world I wouldn't do for you
Just give me one more reason to stay, baby
