In it comes swift, in the nick of
In the nick of time, like a wild light
And it turns the tables like a rhythm, like a fury
Might, leaving nothing unseen
And you ask it why it came, it says 'you spoke me
Here, I am your corners uncovered, I am'
And it pulls the blinders from your sleeping
Casts you in sight, inside it goes
And out it's pouring you
Here — we are ancient, a wind that carries
The rough seed, and we are young and foolish
A reckless whim, yet turning in, look deeper in
To the grinding shoal of the swiftest change
And all we may recall… recall…
What's ours to give, what’s ours to give
In it comes course to your current, sure through
Your veins, like a flood furious and flashing
'mong your limbs'll be bound unless bade
To be set free, the ties untightening -- and only
Made of what you make of them
You wove them here, to every corner uncovered
They lead, so you pull your blinders from your
Sleepin’, set on your way, let all the subtle
Speak on through your ripple out
Here — we are ancient, a wind that carries
The rough seed, and we are young and foolish
A reckless whim, yet turning in, look deeper in
To the grinding shoal of the swiftest change
And all we may recall… recall…
What's ours to give, what’s ours to give
To the brightening home of the ever-change
And all it may recall… what’s ours to give…
