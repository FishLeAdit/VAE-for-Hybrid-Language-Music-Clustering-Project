There's no escaping this restlessness I feel
I put my faith in material things
Too easily
Still I get no peace
Feels more like breaths between drowning
Just like some small release
I'm on the lookout for something new, yeah
Something I can hold on to
Tell me what do you want?
Love
And what do you need?
Peace
And what do I have
Nothing, no
If I don't have me?
Nothing, no
The world is changing, gettin' smaller everyday
Easy to get some place, but hard to get away
I've got a lot to learn
Temptation's there at every turn
All of the roads lead back to me
All of the roads lead back to me
I've got to hold on to the one thing that I know is true
Never give up what you believe
Never give up what you believe
Window shopping to ease the weight
The world on my shoulders
It gets hard to relate
With my family, still I get no peace
Of all these things I see
The only one I need is me
Just one reflection will never do;
I need something I can hold on to
Tell me what do you want?
Love
And what do you need?
Peace
And what do I have
Nothing, no
If I don't have me?
Nothing, no
The world is changing, gettin' smaller everyday
Easy to get some place, but hard to get away
I've got a lot to learn
Temptation's there at every turn
All of the roads lead back to me
But all of the roads lead back to me
I've got to hold on to the one thing that I know is true
Never give up what you believe
Never give up what you believe
I've got a lot to learn
Temptation's there at every turn
All of the roads lead back to me
But all of the roads lead back to me
I've got to hold on to the one thing that I know is true
Never give up what you believe
Never give up what you believe
Never give up what you believe
Never give up
Never give up what you believe
Never give up what you believe
