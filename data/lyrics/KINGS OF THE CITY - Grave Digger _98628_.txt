Every good woman lies
Every good woman lies
When they're wrong... who's gonna bury my mind?
Every grave digger dies
Every grave digger dies
When they're gone... who's gonna bury my body?
When they're gone... who's gonna bury my body?

Living life round this sin, it's how it's been since powers in
Many men pump weight in the council gym, producing ounces in student houses
We choose this outfit 'coz we like to win, but what lies within these lies within? (huh?)
It's like everyone's Breaking Bad, cooking up food to make it fat (oh!)
The streets are cold man, not a smile around in this whole land
Some warm to a life of thrills in William Hill, before it goes all down
Posers medal in the game, a generation wild in abundance
No patience, style over substance, like using heroin in vein

Every good woman lies
Every good woman lies
When they're wrong... who's gonna bury my mind?
Every grave digger dies
Every grave digger dies
When they're gone... who's gonna bury my body?
When they're gone... who's gonna bury my body?

Fuck Knows! In the Olympics the love flowed
But when this rat race falls down on its fat face, I hope you've got enough gold
Yeah fuck silver, I've got enough bolts that if it all screwed I'm going nuts yo
I've got enough clothes, but the greed law says we need more
Do you feel my genes? Social validation agents can kill my dreams
Two shots to the dome, my ego is still my theme
When Lady Gaga and Kim K can fill my screens
I wonder what real life needs are gonna fill my seeds

Every good woman lies
Every good woman lies
When they're wrong... who's gonna bury my mind?
Every grave digger dies
Every grave digger dies
When they're gone... who's gonna bury my body?
When they're gone... who's gonna bury my body?
