Undone
Undone

Why you go there for? These people run up
On me talkin' out the side of they neck
They must have come to get wrecked
They better slow they roll! Before the Uncle Buk
Decides to pull a motherfuckin' tool up
Out the shed and leave 'em wet
Make 'em disappear just like a poltergeist
Mobstyle releases got your record label compromised
Own the night! Fall asleep but hater I keep open eyes
Always keep a killer on the hook, that's Wrekonize (Wrekonize)
'Bout to detonate like any second now
Hit 'em with that underground, Twiztid mobbin' hella sound
Must have been a doozy like a Buk-Slap
Clappin' like an Uzi, ain't no comeback

Huntin' down the lames, I think it's time for the shining
Right behind you, chainsaw sharp as a diamond
Leatherface mind and I blame my environment
You don't want to have a problem when it's time for the grinding

Undone! We've been killin' shit for the vibin'
Run! Run! You don't want these killers behind you
Undone! Everything is bloody and violent
You go runnin' and hidin' but you know that we'll find ya
Undone! We've been killin' shit for the vibin'
Run! Run! You don't want these killers behind you
Undone! Everything is bloody and violent
You go runnin' and hidin' but you know that we'll find ya
Undone!

I'm undone like a shoelace, wrap around your neck
And give your ass a thousand deaths worse than Screwface
Another shadow in my dark-minded rage
With my eyelids erodin' like I'm Zombie Doctor Strange
('Cause everybody has a monster)
New monster up in the cage
Perpetrators think they got my playbook
Because they memorized in one page
Bitch I'll put you all in graves, dig your ass back up
And fuck your face, cut off your arms and your legs (Fuck you motherfucker)
Worm looking ass, human piece of trash
Use this nine pound hammer and give your fuckin' head a smash
Let it sink in, think you're hard, well think again
Have you floatin' to the bottom like Voorhees in the deep end

Huntin' down the lames, I think it's time for the shining
Right behind you, chainsaw sharp as a diamond
Leatherface mind and I blame my environment
You don't want to have a problem when it's time for the grinding

Undone! We've been killin' shit for the vibin'
Run! Run! You don't want these killers behind you
Undone! Everything is bloody and violent
You go runnin' and hidin' but you know that we'll find ya
Undone! We've been killin' shit for the vibin'
Run! Run! You don't want these killers behind you
Undone! Everything is bloody and violent
You go runnin' and hidin' but you know that we'll find ya
Undone!

I came to change up your environment, death is coming
I'm sendin' rappers to retirement, the rest is running
Your chest I'm gunnin' for nothin' less than breath to plummet
Protect your mullet, fuck it, I'll distend your gullet
I got bad news, bad views, and bad vibes
And I choose to bury fools like landslides
I might bruise egos like fat thighs
And my shoes only come under my size
So don't you come lookin' to chastise
Until you live a second a day in my life
'Cause I'm trife, razor and throat slice
I think you better take my advice and stay away from me

Huntin' down the lames, I think it's time for the shining
Right behind you, chainsaw sharp as a diamond
Leatherface mind and I blame my environment
You don't want to have a problem when it's time for the grinding

Undone! We've been killin' shit for the vibin'
Run! Run! You don't want these killers behind you
Undone! Everything is bloody and violent
You go runnin' and hidin' but you know that we'll find ya
Undone! We've been killin' shit for the vibin'
Run! Run! You don't want these killers behind you
Undone! Everything is bloody and violent
You go runnin' and hidin' but you know that we'll find ya
Undone!
