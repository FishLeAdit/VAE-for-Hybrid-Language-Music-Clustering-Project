Layers of green above
Where is the beginning?
Sun rising tries to catch
A glimpse of
Forest floor a branch (Black feathered wings)
Falling through air (Ready to jump)
On sudden sound of wind

Begin
To soar

Transitional bird
When we hear (Ahh, ahh, ahh)
We make a listening sound

Moon rising exchanges (Moon rising exchanges)
Secrets with the leaves (Secrets with the leaves)
Leaves, sitting with you in
A tree
In soft rain feeling there’s (In soft rain feeling there’s)
Time here for everything (Time here for everything)
On sudden sound of wind

Begin
To soar

Transitional bird
When we hear
We make a listening sound


Transitional bird
When we hear
We make a listening sound
Transitional bird
When we hear
We make a listening sound
