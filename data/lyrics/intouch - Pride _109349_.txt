You say: I am dummy
You say: I am lost
You say: I am ugly
You say: I am lust
Supernatural coming through my bones
Creeping in my soul
Dead eyes are glowing
I know it's your fault
I know it's you
Supernatural coming through my bones
Creeping in my soul
You say: I am godless
You say: I am blind
You say: I am useless
You say: I am running away
Supernatural coming through my bones
Creeping in my soul
Supernatural coming through my bones
Creeping in my soul
