What did you have in mind
Should, should I think of everything
Well I'm already blind
And that's, that's how I do things
Old, Old story and the same old song
Making the same mistakes
Why do i even try
Can't put my finger on it, now
And yet, and yet here I go again
Old, Old story and the same old song
All of the weeks I spent
Fighting and socializing
And just, and just where did it get me
Older, but not much wiser
Old, Old story and the same old song
What did you have in mind
Should I think of everything
Old, Old story and the same old song
