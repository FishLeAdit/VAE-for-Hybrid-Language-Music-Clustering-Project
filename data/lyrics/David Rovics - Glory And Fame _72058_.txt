I pulled the stones for the emperor
Stacked 'em up and made that wall
I thought a mountain lasts forever
But the rain must always fall
I worked the mines in Chile
For conquistador
Died there in the pitshaft
Joined my family with the ore
I tapped the trees for Leopold
And then he took my hands
The sap sailed to Brussels
And my blood stained the lands
I cut down the sugar cane
On the islands off the coast
Oh but the sweet taste of freedom
Is the stuff I love the most
Tell me who am I
Do you know my name
Will I lie forgotten
Or arise in glory and fame
I fought with Poncho Villa
Stood with him side by side
When the Bluecoats took the land
I thought how long is freedom's ride
I was there at Haymarket
With the martyrs eight
For striking in Chicago
Death would have to be my fate
I cut the timber in Centralia
Nearly broke my back
Tried to organize a union
And they tied me to the tracks
I fought in Barcelona
Kept the fascists there at bay
Then when Hitler's tanks came rolling in
I knew we couldn't stay
Tell me who am I
Do you know my name
Will I lie forgotten
Or arise in glory and fame
I mined the ore in Arizona
Last of the Navajo
Got the radium a-glowin'
Then it was time for me to go
I marched in South Africa
Found myself in Sharpeville
Once the police came and went
I was lying oh so still
I campaigned for Allende
For a nation without fear
Didn't look behind me
For the day I'd disappear
I spoke at Tienanmen
To revive the revolution
Didn't think for Deng Xiaoping
Rolling tanks were his solution
Tell me who am I
Do you know my name
Will I lie forgotten
Or arise in glory and fame
I grew the mangoes in Somalia
For the people in the west
And when the price for fruit went down
I went down starving with the rest
I worked the plant in Bangkok
Breathed the dusty air
When the cotton started burning
I knew my life would not be spared
The cops beat me in Los Angeles
But I would not be scared
When they sent the Army in
I thought next time we'll be prepared
Yes, I've been yearning for a new day
All the worldwide
Someday my time will come
And you will have to step aside
Tell me who am I
Do you know my name
Will I lie forgotten
Or arise in glory and fame
