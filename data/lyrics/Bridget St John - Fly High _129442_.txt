The world is so full of a number of things
And I think we should all be as happy as kings
So please don't be down if your day should turn sour
There are so many good things, just think of a colour
You will fly, fly high
And see the many wonders that the seasons bring to you
Autumn burning red and amber, summer burning blue
And please remember all you have and not what you might lose
It isn't always easy but it's better when you do
You will fly, fly high
I love you happy and I love you sad
I will love you through good and I will love you through bad
We will fly, fly high
The world is so full of a number of things
And I think we should all be as happy as kings
So please remember all you have and not what you might lose
It isn't always easy but it's better when you do
You will fly, fly high, fly high
