Yo
I lost a couple years of past 'til we parted ways
Back in my bastard days a past that was masked with rage
Met you when I was seventeen and since then
There's never been a senorita that's meant what you meant to me
I'm just a hollow man that raps on a empty beat
Thinkin' when we weren't separate entities but times have changed
I need to find my brain
In this crazy world
Where you go crazy for a girl
What I do to give her daisy and some pearls
But my lady she's gone
And as I'm writing this song and I was rightfully wrong
For letting you go, I'm letting you know
Life works in mysterious ways
And we were stuck in the delirious days
Didn't wanna leave London to pursue your dreams
A hundred miles away
And you know you couldn't moved with me
Somethin' like a movie scene, holdin' you close
Tears streaming down your cheeks when you speak
You're just telling me no
It's just me and you why should I go?
One reason, you need to be a woman on your own
And I'm a King Of The City sat down on my throne
So I keep on lovin' you until the lovin' is gone
And so she left, end of scene right
Many nights passed where we didn't see eyes
Wish I could rewrite the sands of time
Reversin' this planet of mine
'Cause losin' you to another man wasn't in any plans of mine
But I did
Told me you had fallen for him
But who the fuck is this guy
And why's he up in my life?
Was it the distance apart
Or partly 'cause I partied with a party down the wrong path
 strong 
You were supposed to be my Wife
Makin' the most of the most
A toast to the  our life
So things ended there, to arrogant
Tekeshi was my first love
The worst drug that I got was bread
Rosalita, ooh
Rosalita, ooh
Singin'

Rosalita
Darling only in our minds
Somethings become nothings
And every things the same
In the days of old
The only thing that sold
In everybody's mind
Is something they can't find

Yo, yo
A year went by and you wanted see me out of the blue
These times I was livin' with Delman and chillin' with crew
Couple floozies on the pole you know how we role
But really fuckin' a hoe and a hoe was never my goal
So I snuck away and  and gave you a hug
Then we made love a couple times under the sun
Smiles and kisses, no lies or disses
Reminiscin' with my misses on our time was for fun
But what we'd done was rekindled the flame
There was somethin' on your mind
Couldn't live with the shame
I remember when I was drivin' you home
You went quiet and became nervous
An expression on your face like you just murdered
Told me that you done a thing with a man in my ring
And said  fling that happened a couple years back
Behind my back, then blatantly been bear chattin'
Boys will be boys therefore no one would dare rap
Didn't wanna hear the truth, all this shit is loose
Right about now I wanna go and get a noose
Told who was the snake, then my whole world earthquake
For fuck's sake, anyone but him
Known him most my life, he lived a couple doors from
My so-called best friend had no remorse I see
He was like a brother, but my brother had to rub up on my lover
Should've listened to my Mother
But I didn't bother
In the meantime you said you would wait
Even though you already had another man on your plate
This is bait, I'm  the man in your 
I gotta go yo, 'cause that's waiting and I'm running late
I'ma throw away the keys to the lovers gate
'Cause you're nothing but trouble mate
So things ended there, to arrogant
Tekeshi was my first love
The worst drug that I got was bread
Rosalita, ooh
Rosalita, ooh
Singin'

Rosalita
Darling only in our minds
Somethings become nothings
And every things the same

The only thing that sold
