Alliteration for the nation, consonance for continents
I hope the consequence is that you bob your head to this

Justifiable rythym
Asking what you been missin’
Pimps so corporate n’ kissin
Values are tied in the lynching
All the fat needs some pinchin
Steady youth in a prison
No lovin’ supervision
There’s no cooks in the kitchen
Poison water no fishin’
All the sales men are pitchin’
To steal cause circumcision
Rape us continue snitchin’
Money drugs over bitches
I see something real different
I’ll be holdin’ a vision
It’s not just superstition

Something sacred sewed me sideways
I’m Mirrored, mimickin’ and movin’ my way
Holy hell on a hardened highway
Feeling freaky focused
Friday to Friday

I’m fighting my ego
I think may be it’s sequel
Is opposite of evil
Sugar fucked up my equal
Never researched the prequel
Toxins all in your fecal
Poppin’ pills swelling measle
Tell me where is my people
They don’t bow at no steeple
Lightworkers gettin deepa
Quantum physics’ll teach ya
My lyrics they might reach ya
Read the poems I preach ya
This full length is my feature
A mysterious creature
We are one blood all keepers

Something sacred sewed me sideways
I’m Mirrored, mimickin’ and movin’ my way
Holy hell on a hardened highway
Feeling freaky focused
Friday to Friday

My spaceship is leavin’
Out the window I’m seein’
End of left brain per diem
Psychics say they can see them
Daddy’s fightin my demons
Beside me steady dreamin
That he helps me make freedom
From the grave he is screamin
F! the man and his semen
Kinda fishy no reason
Corporation is reakin’
Smells of workers well treated
Earth mother she is fienin’
For a break in the season
Discontent no one pleasin’
Called a cunt that is bleedin’

Something sacred sewed me sideways
I’m Mirrored, mimickin’ and movin’ my way
Holy hell on a hardened highway
Feeling freaky focused
Friday to Friday
Alliteration for the nation, consonance for continents
I hope the consequence is that you bob your head to this
