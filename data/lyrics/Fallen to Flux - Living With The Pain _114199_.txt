Into the path that I am taking in my life
Is conducted when I try to sleep
Or even shut my eyes
True burdens guilt and fear
Condemn the recent and the end
Another bridge to cross
Another obstacle to contend with on the way
So do you think you're fine?
Or are you just living with the pain?
You say I've gone too far
I drag mistakes like rope
And then choose the rough terrain
I can't ignore my scars
They mark the man I want to be so bad again
So do you think you're fine?
Or are you just living with the pain?
My dreams are where I take refuge
The one place I can live a life beyond my touch
But still I yearn for insomnia
To force myself to make them real
It can't take much
What is there left to do
When all you do is torment yourself?
You suffer sleepless nights
Through paranoia and your selfish sense of plight
So do you have a reason why?
Or are you just scared to lose this fight?
You say I've gone too far
I drag mistakes like rope
And then choose the rough terrain
I can't ignore my scars
They mark the man I want to be so bad again
So do you think you're fine?
Or are you just living with the pain?
So do you think you're fine?
Or are you just living with the pain?
You say I've gone too far
I drag mistakes like rope
And then choose the rough terrain
I can't ignore my scars
They mark the man I want to be so bad again
No I don't think I'm fine
But I'm just living with the pain
