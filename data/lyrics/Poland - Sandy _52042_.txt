Livin' in the back streets
Sittin' in the back seat
On her way to a crystal stone
Drinkin' like it's water
She doesn't know her daughter
Is looking for a brand new home
Sandys got the shivers
Her voice has got the quivers
'Cause her flights gone for way too long
She'll buy it if you're selling
If she's got none she starts yelling
But the rage has just begun

(Woah Woah) Sandy
(Woah Woah) Sandy
(Woah Woah) Sandy
(Woah Woah) Sandy

Sandys got no money
All she's got is golden honey
And a whole lot of nothing left
Her daughters paying bills, while
Sandys popping pills
And doing what she doеs best
Theres no locks on thе doors
And theres holes up through the floor
And the ceiling is falling down
Sandys feeling shitty
'Cause she knows its such a pity
That she can't turn her life around

(Woah Woah) Sandy
(Woah Woah) Sandy
(Woah Woah) Sandy
(Woah Woah) Sandy


(Woah Woah) Sandy
(Woah Woah) Sandy
(Woah Woah) Sandy
(Woah Woah) Sandy
(Woah Woah) Sandy

(Woah Woah) Sandy
