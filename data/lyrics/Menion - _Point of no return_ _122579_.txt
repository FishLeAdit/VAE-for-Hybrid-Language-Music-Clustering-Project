I don't believe in dealing friends away for love
Or kicking people's hearts to get my thrills
Lately you are all i'm thinking of
And my desire for you is growin' stronger than my will
So lead me unto temptation
This fire in my heart will surely burn
I think i'm trailing off the the straight and narrow path i walk
There's a darker side of love i'm bound to learn
I'm standing at the point of no return
Sometimes the difference between right and wrong is fear
And sometimes love is somеthing that you steal
There's somеting that gets me everytime your near
And all i really care about is how you make me feel
There's people in our lives
Don't deserve these kind of lies
And the heartaches that we all seem to pretend
It gets stronger every day
Gets hard to turn away
When i look across the room and catch you staring
So lead me unto temptation
This fire in my heart will surely burn
I think i'm trailing off the the straight and narrow path i walk
There's a darker side of love i'm bound to learn
I'm standing at the point of no return
