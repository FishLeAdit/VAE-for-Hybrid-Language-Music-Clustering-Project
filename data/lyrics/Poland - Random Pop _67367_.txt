I know what you're thinking
You wish you stayed in bed
Or moved to some place safe and zombie-free
They're rotten and stinking
And shall we say "undead"
And deathly afraid of botany
These seeds I've brought
Are how we beat them
These plants repel undead remains
And if those plants fail to defeat them
They'll feast upon our (brains)

Plant a little plant in the garden
That's guardin' your lawn
'Cause an army of the dead are now knocking at your door!
Plant a little plant in the garden
Or your yard'll be gone
So let's plant a couple plants in the garden
For war!

Time to bring in the big guns!
Some sunlight and soil
Are all we really need
To cut these zombies lowlifes down to size
They're dogged and vile
And wear expensive tweed
But also not known to be awfully wise

The zombies are coming
Stumbling down the street!
They're searching for somebody's
Pink, yummy-tasting brain to eat!
The groans and the moans
And the creek of the bones of the zombie fleet
Shed some light on our plight
That we might just be dead meat!

Plant a little plant in the garden
Discard all your stress
Though our odds of any serious survival plans look low
Plant a little plant in the garden
Please pardon the mess
But you better pick a plant for your garden
To grow!

Golly, couldn't we just
Plant some grizzly bears or something?
Shotguns jam and axes break
And chainsaws tend to stall
But my flora is grade A guaranteed!
Outbreaks are a piece of cake
'Cause my plants stand through it all
So let go of dread, don't fear the dead
When these plants are all you need!

Plant a little plant in the garden
That's startin' to fill
There's a giant wave of slow-moving zombies aimed this way!
Plant a little plant in the garden
They're hardy to kill
So let's plant another plant in the garden
A leafy pea-shootin' spartan
Just plant a little plant in the garden today!
