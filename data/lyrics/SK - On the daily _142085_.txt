Yes, skoolboy
Uh
This is one of those songs you feel
Well this is how i feel
Uh
90s kids

Now you can look me in my eyes say im destined to shine got the hood saying skoolboy is the best of his time. music is the hustle so i stare at the grind and the haters gonna hate so he accepts it. patience is a test so he expects it. but i just want love so please respect it. im a king a champion i always will be. a warrior when he writes so yall can't kill me. samurai voice so he chops the beat up. they couldn't hear me at first so i had to speak up. music is the only thing that really matters and im climbing to the top like im on a ladder. money is the motivation but i ain't in no rush. one mic one stage thats enough. cause ive been waiting on this all my life. and i will not stop until im in the spotlight
