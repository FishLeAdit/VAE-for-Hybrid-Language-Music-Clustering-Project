Inclusion lives through us all, love binds us together so we won’t fall
No matter how big or small
For each other: We’ll break down walls
When it all falls apart and we’re a million miles away
We can still be together in many different ways

We’re all alone together, talking with each other
We’ve learned to make new friends and love one another and even-though we’re apart
We’re together at heart
Looking into the future, there’s a better place to start

We’re all alone together while the world is standing still
Together forever , forever together (Together forever, forever together)

We need to be reaching out to those who  are down and out
Let’s come together in Friendship: it’s what it’s all about
In our darkest hour , let our voices be louder
Let our light shine  Cause’ there’s a higher power

All alone together, talking with each other
We’ve learned to make new friends and love one another and even-though we’re apart
We’re together at heart
Looking into the future , there’s a better place to start

We’re all alone together while the world is standing still
Together forever, forever together (Together forever, forever together)
