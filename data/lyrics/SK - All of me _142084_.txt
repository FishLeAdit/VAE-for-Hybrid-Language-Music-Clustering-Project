All of me why not take all of me can't you see I'm no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them take my arms I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry how can I go on without you
You took the part that once was my heart so why not take all of me
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry how can I go on dear without you
You took the part that once was my heart so why not take all of me
