Go
Run till you're runnin' out
Scream till you cannot shout
Wait for the night fall

You broke my heart in two
Unfaithfulness painted on your dress in blue

Now go
Run till you're runnin' out
Scream till you cannot shout
Wait for the night fall

I never knew such pain
Watchin', watchin', darkness follows me

Now go
Run till you're runnin out
Scream till you cannot shout
Wait for the night to fall

Go
Run till you're runnin' out
Scream till you cannot shout
Wait for the night fall
Go
Run till you're runnin' out
Scream till you cannot shout
Wait for the night fall
