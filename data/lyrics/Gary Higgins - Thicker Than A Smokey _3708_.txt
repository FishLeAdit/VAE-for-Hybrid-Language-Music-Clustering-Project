What do you intend to do young man?
Where do you intend to go?
Will you take a trip to the deep dark South
Down into Mexico? Oh, oh
If you travel with a spider in your duffel bag
With you good weather goes
And if you get hung on a frozen stair
Be here for the snow, oh oh
It's often that I wish to leave myself
Buy me some fancy clothes
Get on a stretch of a winding road
All in my canvas show, oh oh
Honey I'll be ridin' in a cadillac
Must a' took an over dose
Quicker than a locy down a railroad track
Honey wasn't even close
If I had little message I could leave you with
I'd hang it on the door
But I don't and it's just no use anymore
No good anymore, oh oh
Honey I'll be hustlin' to make up slack
Gimme little hangin' rope
Thicker than a smokey from a factory stack
Honey wasn't even close
What do you intend to do young man?
Where do you intend to go?
Will you take a trip to the deep dark South
Down into Mexico? Oh, oh
