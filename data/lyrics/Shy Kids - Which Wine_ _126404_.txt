Money will give you wine
Any kind you'd seek in paradise
But i don't know which one that i want...
I don't know which one that i'd like...
Can't choose when there's a lot, i'm picky
For now, i'll stick to taste and tot
But i don't know which one that i want...
I don't know which one that i'd like...
Thought it would be easier though
Give it a smell, is it just like your old home?
I don't think i like this type
I don't think i like this, i don't think i like this
But i'll give you a try
If you give me your's, i'll give you mine
Cuz i just want to like myself, i just want to like myself
Maybe you'll make me might
Send those warm chills up my spine
But i don't know which one that i want...
I don't know which one that i'd like...
Thought it would be easier...
Thought it would easy but no
Thought it would be easy to take you home
I could drink a lot, drink a lot, drink a lot of wine
I could drink a lot, drink a lot, drink a lot of wine
Thought it would easy but no
Thought it would be easy to take you home
I could drink a lot, drink a lot, drink a lot of wine
I could drink a lot, drink a lot, drink a lot of wine
But i don't know which one that i want...
I don't know which one that i'd like...
