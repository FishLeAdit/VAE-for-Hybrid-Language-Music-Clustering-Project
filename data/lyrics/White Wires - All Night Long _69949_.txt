You tell me I’m the one I’m the only one
Why have you got to be like that?
Another time promise, I’m down on my luck
Can it really be that bad?
Give me doubt do it, you do not want
Why have you got to be like that?
You tell me I’m the one I’m the only one
Why have you got to be like that?
All night long
We wanna party
All night long
