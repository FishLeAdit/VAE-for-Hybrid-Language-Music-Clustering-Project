Got to face a changing planet
Weather, land, ocean, and air
Population out of balance
Wages world warfare
Can we fix it with our love?
Can we rise above?
Got to face myself
Can I manage?
Ride those emotional waves
Will I just let it happen?
The crush of hours
The crash of days
Can I learn from my love?
Can I rise above?
The rising tide, the rising tide
Face to face with my lover
Finding recognition there
We take comfort in one another
Take time, take care
Can we live on our love?
Can we rise above?
The rising tide
The rising tide
The rising tide
The rising tide
