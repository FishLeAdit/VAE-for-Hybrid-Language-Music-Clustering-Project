There's safety in the numbers of this godforsaken town
It's been a week since all of this went down
In this abandoned factory, there's no one here but you and me
And god help any fool who comes around
And you, with your coy and fickle eyes, you'll get your way
And me, I have got no say in my own destiny
The way it's going, Stickybee, you will be the death of me, oh no
It didn't go the way I planned, we had it in our hands
And everyone had followed our demands
But then you shot that plainclothes cop, I heard a pop and watched him drop
Now we both have blood upon our hands
And you, well, you made it sound so simple and it was
And now, I am a fugitive and you're the only cause
The way it's going, Stickybee, you will be the death of me, oh no
Oh shit, I think I heard a sound from over by the door
I see their shadows looming on the floor
An inch, a mile, it's all the same, now that I am in this game
A shout is heard and time is running out
And you, in the chaos of the moment grab your gun
And you, you aim the barrel at that two ton oil drum
Now I know it, Stickybee, you will be the death of me
Now I know it, Stickybee, you will be the death of me, oh no
