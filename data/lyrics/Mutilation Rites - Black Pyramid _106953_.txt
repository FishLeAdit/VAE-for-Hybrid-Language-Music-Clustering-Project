Building layers upon layers
Levels of guilt
Decades of regression
Eons of suffering
Relax and feel sand wash over
Constructing a giant
Reaching for the sky
A graceful and peaceful ending
Sawdust and jagged edges
The cold metal of a gun
And reflections of why we are all wrong
That same feeling day in and day out
Failures inhuman and vile but timeless
