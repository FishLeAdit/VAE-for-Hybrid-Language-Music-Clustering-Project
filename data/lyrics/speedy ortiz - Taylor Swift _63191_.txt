Baby, my baby, my baby
I'll bring you to term
Whose baby?
My baby
Baby, will I ever learn?
You wanna love, wanna hate
Want me up, want me down
Gave up my baby for more babies
See you around

'Cause now, I've got a boy in a hardcore band
I've got a boy, gets it on to Can
Then there's a boy, sings those sad songs I like
I've got too many boyfriends to see you tonight
I've got too many boyfriends to see you

Blood-shaking, clot-making viper that feeds on a mouse
Poaching the eggs of the snakes that I slayed in the south
Over and under and sideways
I'm great at Ka-Prow!
Gave up my baby for more babies
See you around

'Cause now, I've got a boy in a hardcore band
I've got a boy, likes to fuck to Can
Then there's the boy, sings those sad songs I like
I've got too many boyfriends to see you tonight
I've got too many boyfriends to see you!
