Oh, it's a costume party?
Oh honey, you can’t wear that
Is this supposed to be a costume?
Do you like scary movies?

I sure hope you know that you’re in danger
Tear you down call us bone rearranger
So demented looking like a stranger
I sure hope you know that you're in danger

(I know where you live)
Count your minutes, count your hours, count your days, sis
Cut you slack, cut you off in a haze, sis
Watch your step, watch your tone, watch your language
Lost my will but I will never lose my way sis
I am spooky, you are lazy, you are a rat, go talk to Maisy
Check your attitude, this chick is mad at you
It don’t matter who, go and clean your battlе wound (Kisses)
You not right in the head
Your town is paintеd red
Check out my demon hat
Okay, miss Doja Cat!

I sure hope you know that you’re in danger
Tear you down call us bone rearranger
So demented looking like a stranger
I sure hope you know that you're in danger

Start digging your grave now
Ain’t feeling so brave now

(You good?)
Accidentally got short hair like Katy (Help, help)
I shoulda ran from that haircut lady
I could sit on the porch cuz I look so shady (Spooky boots)
This ginger hair gonna sink like Sadie

You look like a witch
We just stay here getting rich
You spooky stanky like fish
Get that candy out of that dish (Take one)
Trick or treat
You smell like Frankenstein's feet
Shed a tear, you gonna retreat
You look like you eat whole wheat (Ugh, ew)

I sure hope you know that you’re in danger
Tear you down call us bone rearranger
So demented looking like a stranger
I sure hope you know that you're in danger

Start digging your gr-
Ain’t feeling so brave now

Sharp like a knife, sinks in like a fang
We’ll end your life, got you screaming dang
