I was waiting at the bando
I’m jus' tryna be your mans tho
And tell me where did all this time go
And I'ma leave if you say so
I was waiting at the bando (Oh)

Uh, I was waiting at the bando
Tryna get lit like a candle
FILA socks all on my ankles
Pretty blonde hair ,but it's tangled

My name is EGO I wear sandals
I was posted sipping Remy, now I'm tryna play the banjo
It was nice outside so tranquil
But baby, now it’s fucking raining so please change the channel

I was waiting at the bando
I’m jus' tryna be your mans tho
And tell me where did all this time go
And imma leave if you say so
