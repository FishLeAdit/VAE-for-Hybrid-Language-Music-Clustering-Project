I told you everything and now I feel so good
I can’t help but think this is how all people should feel
Yeah, I still got some stories to keep you laughing and on the edge of your seat, but
You won’t find skeletons with me, no you won’t no find skeletons with me
A gate pass at the airport, helped you out with your broken arm
We laughed and joked about “what she said”, spoke of love on old train cars
And then things took a turn toward serious, we talked secrets and regrets
And what we said there at Gate B2, I don’t think I’ll ever forget
‘Cause I told you everything and now I feel so good
I can’t help but think this is how all people should feel
Yeah, I still got some stories to keep you crying and on the edge of your seat, but
You won’t find skeletons with me, no you won’t no find skeletons with me
And how do we protect the children? And use our money to make God proud?
We believed our destinies were intertwined, and my office on the lake will have a window looking out
I told you everything and now I feel so good
I can’t help but think this is how all people should feel
Yeah, I still got some stories to keep you laughing and on the edge of your seat, but
You won’t find skeletons with me, no you won’t no find skeletons with me
Finally, I told you things I hadn’t known how, but wanted to for years
And you told me secrets you’d wanted to, but only prayed about in tears
You said hang tight, wait for your life, I said it feels so weird
Sang how beautiful and strange this life, but thank God it brought us here
‘Cause I told you everything now
I told you everything now

Yeah, I still got some stories to keep you laughing and on the edge of your seat, but
You won’t find skeletons with me

‘Cause I told you everything and now I feel so good
I can’t help but think this is how all people should feel
I still got some stories to keep you laughing and on the edge of your seat, but
You won’t find skeletons with me
Yeah, I still got some stories to keep you breathless and on the edge of your seat, but
You won’t find skeletons with me, no you won’t no find skeletons with me
Oh, you won’t find no skeletons with me
