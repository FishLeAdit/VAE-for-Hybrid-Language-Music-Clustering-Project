Old weapons
Old wars
New weapons
Old wars
I can't remember
The warmth of November
The cold of December
Is only forever
Comes down to this
Do you want that or this
To hear the word "Destroy"
Society was joyed
Sing a song
Sing anything
Dusk and dawn
Only everything
The question of gravity
To answer with gravity
Additional irony
Everyone’s loving me
Comes down to this
Do you want that or this
The hear the word "Destroy"
Society was joyed
See me believe
We need to believe
(Reversed lines and words)
I can't remember
The warmth of November
The cold of December
Is only forever
I can't remember
Is only forever
I can’t remember
Is only forever
Is only forever
