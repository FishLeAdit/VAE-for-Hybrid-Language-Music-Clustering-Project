Many a life I've tried
Many a tear I've cried
Your heart is a twisted vine
That loves but none at a time
You see none at a time
And I see you have a lady
She brings you your bread and your wine
And your heart is a twisted vine
That comes but once in a while to me
Once in a while
Where are you, sweet Marie?
I'm floating on an apple tree
And I'm telling all the world that I once knew
That I'm in love with you
Where are you, sweet honey?
I'm floating on an apple tree
And I'm telling all the world that I once knew
That I'm in love with you
Many a life I've tried
Many a tear I've cried
Your heart is a twisted vine
That loves but none at a time
You see none at a time
Where am I, sweet Marie?
I'm floating on an apple tree
And I'm telling all the world that I once knew
That I'm in love with you
Where are you, sweet honey?
I'm floating on an apple tree
And I'm telling all the world that I once knew
That I'm in love with you
