Even through the darkness there is light
I do what helps me through the day
You ain't never ever gotta worry
Cause everything's gonna be okay
(Feel this shit)
And I... promise there's a better place
If you tough it out through the rain
It's a blessing from above that I'm doing what I love
And I never thought I'd feel this way

I learned a valuable lesson
Managers got me stressing
Always second-guessing
Was left with unanswered questions
Fuck a nine to five and you try to make this my job
It's my art, my creative mind, everything you not
And won't, ever experience cause you ain't as intelligent
Open your mind and understand the world that we living in
Titles really mean nothing unless behind them is millions
Then again half these rich motherfuckers who think they're brilliant
Either ends up killing theirself or they go delirious
Damn, that shit's serious I guess money is venimous
I bet all of my enemies are jealous of my excellence
Cut tracks like holy testaments writing the bars of Exodus
Always afraid to sign my light and create a mind
If you only in it for now then you ain't a part of my life
You gotta be in it for dreams, you gotta be planting seeds
You gotta take time to grow, you gotta take time to breathe cause

Even through the darkness there is light
I do what helps me through the day
You ain't never ever gotta worry
Cause everything's gonna be okay
(Feel this shit)
And I... promise there's a better place
If you tough it out through the rain
It's a blessing from above that I'm doing what I love
And I never thought I'd feel this way

Y'all people be lacking knowledge
I'm greatfully paying homage
To people who make an honest living, grinding for them dollars
While working up on that grave shift, and you ain't even paid shit
Embrace the face of everyone up in this nation
An argument ain't a legit argument unless it's backed up
Ignorance is bliss, gotta learn your facts brah
And one day get your stacks up
And learn that this life ain't what it seem
Man this life is but a dream
Upon the internet streaming it
And I ain't rowing a boat
I ain't got no where to go
Ain't no one slowing this smoke
That I take it with every toke
I really never had money
But really never was broke
So for that let's take a toast
Pour it up let's make the most
And forget this ever happened
Cause none of this really matters
Your life is just an illusion
So homie better find your passion
I'm thanking god I found rapping
With out it life would be tragic
Weaving in and out of this traffic one day this shit is gonna be classic

Even through the darkness there is light
I do what helps me through the day
You ain't never ever gotta worry
Cause everything's gonna be okay
(Feel this shit)
And I... promise there's a better place
If you tough it out through the rain
It's a blessing from above that I'm doing what I love
And I never thought I'd feel this way

Way, way, way ,way, way, way, way, way, way
Way, way, way ,way, way, way
Never thought I'd feel this way
Way, way, way ,way, way, way, way, way, way
Way, way, way ,way, way, way

Even through the darkness there is light
I do what helps me through the day
You ain't never ever gotta worry
Cause everything's gonna be okay
(Feel this shit)
And I... promise there's a better place
If you tough it out through the rain
It's a blessing from above that I'm doing what I love
And I never thought I'd feel this way
