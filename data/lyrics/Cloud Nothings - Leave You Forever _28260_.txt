In the morning when you come over
I'll be thinking about you
Even after you know why I say
Even after you know why I say
(Chorus)
I could never leave you forever
I could never leave you forever
I could never leave you forever
I could never leave you forever
Ooh...
In the morning when you come over
I'll be thinking about you
Even after you know why I say
Even after you know why I say
(Chorus x2)
Ooh...
