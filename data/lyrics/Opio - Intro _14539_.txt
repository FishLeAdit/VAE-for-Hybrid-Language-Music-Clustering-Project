I'll be on the way, only want the best for you
If you wanna stay, only give my best to you
If you wanna go, I wish the best for you, mmh
I'll be on the way, only want the best for you
If you wanna stay, only give my best to you (Yah)
If you wanna go, I wish the best for you, mmh

I keep your picture in my phone case, sometimes
Metallic moonshine, paint the highway, tears on my face
There's beauty in all of the small things
You crash and you burn 'til you live and you learn and you stay

I'll be on the way, only want the best for you (Yeah)
If you wanna stay, only give my best to you
If you wanna go, I wish the best for you, mmh (Uh, okay)
I'll be on the way, only want the best for you
If you wanna stay, only give my best to you
If you wanna go, I wish the best for you, mmh

How the sun still up in the night time? (All night)
Am I running out of lifelines?
Is it weak when I say that I need you? (God)
Long drives under stars, ceiling see-through

We sharing fries at the drive-thru (Yeah)
Thinking, "One day, I'ma wife you"
Joking 'round 'cause I'm scared it'll scare you
Look at everything we've been through, oh-oh

The silence split the car in two
I don't wanna hear no bad news, bad news

I'll be on the way, only want the best for you (Yeah)
If you wanna stay, only give my best to you
If you wanna go, I wish the best for you, mmh
I'll be on the way, only want the best for you
If you wanna stay, only give my best to you
If you wanna go, I wish the best for you, mmh
