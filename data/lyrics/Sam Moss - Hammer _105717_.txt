Chorus (Maika);
Why can’t u tell me, where it came from
And why can't you tell me, when it begun
Yeah I hope that I’m helping, as your voice of reason
But I know that you’re losing, to the monster you’ve become
Verse 1;
Y'all know it's hard to find meaning in meaningless lines
I try grind and cry 'til my minds sublime
And I in my minds eye
Envision a perfect crime
In a world where words and I align
And I find my work's less worthless than chasing my next high
So I rewrite and work this 'til the flow and rhyme combine
Hell that's what I would be if I wasn't trapped in my mind
"But this time, but this time" I phrase in these lines
As if repeating myself would change fabric of my kind
As if exhaling this hell would make my words more refined
Like it would reign in my Id and rid the problems that fix my brain with a sigh
Shit
I hope these lines aren't too complex
If you're vexed I'll help you decide
You can hate me, no stress what's left ain't much to love by
"Its egregious" you say "how could you leave us behind"
"How could you take a hiatus, say that you hate and shut us out till we die?"
Sorry, I don't choose my behavior
It's just this monster inside
Chorus (Maika (over Mocha sample));
Why can’t u tell me, where it came from
And why can't you tell me, when it begun
Yeah I hope that I’m helping, as your voice of reason
But I know that you’re losing, it's a monster you’ve become
Sample (Mocha);
For God so love the world
As to give his only begotten son
And who so ever beliveth in him, shall not perish
But have everlasting
For God so love the world
As to give his only begotten son
And who so ever believe in him, shall not perish
But have eternal life
Chorus (Maika);
Why can’t u tell me, where you came from
Yeah why can't you tell me, when this all begun
I hope that I’m helping, as your voice of reason
Verse 2;
If I could stop acting for myself all the time
And you could being so goddamn divine
I thought that we could be something that spans between times
But after everything I’m starting to theorize
That there was never just, one and two, there was actually three sides
Shit, all this recollecting got me to realize
That love ain't nothing but well kept secrets and lies
But we keep it all bottled inside till we die
Hell
That’s not the way I envisioned we'd be
Meaningless words three, blotting forgotten apologies
Man every day's a battle, but I’m not gonna concede
Yeah, I’m not gonna stop fighting till these monsters defeat
Chorus (Maika);
Why can’t u tell me, where it came from
And why can't you tell me, when we begun (When it begun)
Yeah I hope that I’m helping, as your voice of reason
But I know that you’re losing, it's a monster you’ve become
