I don't need your pretty eyes
Or the words you use to hypnotize
I don't trust my friends, they're always lying to me
So why do I keep their fucking company
Who cares (Who cares)
Don't need nobody but me
I'm not superstitious
Yeah, I won't be begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Woah-oh-oh
I don't feel like crying
Yeah, I'm too tired, but I'll keep trying
I don't want to sleep, because I don't want to dream
I'm just a fish in a bowl made up to look like the sea
No more smelling flowers while I'm in the weeds
I'm not superstitious
Yeah, I won't be begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Woah-oh-oh
I don't feel like crying
I'm not superstitious
And I won't be begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
Begging for forgiveness
