Having a dream
Then the heart of night
Crossing my mind
But it’s out of sight
I’ve got a wild feeling
The face is an ache baby
Eyes like a child
When were young
I bet you were wild
And to make it in a state of truth
Words are covering your face
I was a sun child
I had my ways and I had my doubts
For once, I thought that ..wants my heart
For once, I thought...wild dog out
But I can’t even hit a fuckin note that high
Didn’t even had to try
Havin the one, the night, the day
And I had my time, that flew away
I’ve got a wild feeling, baby
