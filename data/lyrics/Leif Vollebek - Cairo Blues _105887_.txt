Cairo, Cairo
Cairo is my baby’s home
See, women in Cairo, women in Cairo
Sure don’t dance, they don't dance alone

I should have never lent you my 45
I guess my lesson is not to lend
There’s a big needle going over the line
And for a time you have a friend
But stone cold silence in the room means the record is at its end
You’re turning it over so many times
It’s never going back into its sleeve again
There’s two sides to every story
But it seems like you’ve got ten
When I get no letters, it’s the Cairo blues you send

Cairo, Cairo
Cairo is my baby’s home
See, women in Cairo, women in Cairo
Sure don’t dance, they don't dance alone

Now I know that every time you get lonesome
You go and fill yourself to the brink
Find yourself a man in a suit and tie
Who’ll introduce you to what he drinks
He’s answering your questions funny now
So you’ll wonder how he thinks
He sees his reflection in your skin
You’re gonna see yours in the hotel sinks
Staring back, the Cairo blues it never blinks

Cairo, Cairo
Cairo is my baby’s home
See, women in Cairo, women in Cairo
Sure don’t dance, they don't dance alone

Now I'm looking at those thin winter trees
And they're looking like railings for the sky
I got my bare hands in my coat pockets
And it’s so cold that I could cry
When I see that forest falling, all I hear is firewood
And it's crackling louder than that record ever could
But it don’t drown out those Cairo blues for good

Cairo, Cairo
Cairo is my baby’s home
See, women in Cairo, in Cairo
They don't dance alone
