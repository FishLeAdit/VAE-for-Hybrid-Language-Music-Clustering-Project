We're passed the end of nowhere
All along the worn out plane
Where the devil eyes await
And it gets too dark to rain
It gets too dark to rain
Never going through the darkness
Never ever leave my sight
There's just too many crazes
And you can die just beyond the light


They say that Jesus saves
Ha well, I've seen none of that down here
I just see people with a hunger
I just see people with a fear
And I can see the jungle roaring
All those huddled in steam
Are they just some hungry mouths to feed?
Or the bitter end of dream?


Where the river comes a-rolling
Where the levy tends to break
We're to walk the streets at night, well
It's not a risk that you would take
'Cause it's cold, it's cold down the river
But you can see the Memphis bell
This is no scene from heaven
This could be seen as hell


We're passed the end of nowhere
All along the worn out plane
Where the devil eyes await
And it gets too dark to rain
It gets too dark to rain
It gets too dark
