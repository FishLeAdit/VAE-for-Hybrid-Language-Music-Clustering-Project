You promised me you'd tell no lies
But I can see it's in your eyes
So now I have to read your mind
To see what I can find

I thought we set the perfect scene
Of modern love, but it can't be
The world may really want to change
But for now it's still the same

But I've got a new spell, a new spell
Be careful what you say and do
'Cause I've got a new spell
Be careful what you say and do


'Cause I've got a new spell, a new spell
Be careful what you say and do
I've got a new spell
Be careful what you say and do

You've changed
You've changed
You

I've got a new spell, a new spell
Be careful what you say and do
I've got a new spell
Be careful what you say and do
Be careful what you say and do
I've got a new spell, a new spell
