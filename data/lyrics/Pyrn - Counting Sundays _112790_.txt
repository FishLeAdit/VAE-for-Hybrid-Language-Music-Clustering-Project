There's something cranky 'bout my room-mate tonight
He often stands by the usual side
Next to the window without steel bars
With the view of purple night
Please, don't disturb the pleasure
He made only for himself
I don't experience the passing of time
Feels like it's frozen somewhere out of my sight
Really, I can't tell if I am
Voluntarily in this plan ?
It's been a pretty long time since I've been here...
Since I am...
Lost with all those pills of welfare
For the noon and two for goodnight
But still observed as an insane man
Looking forward to Sundays drowned in you eyes
Sudden changes of moods can bring us good fun
Slowly our habits become examples of numb
We find ourselves in deep silence
Gently, mildly satisfied
We drive ourselves quickly as a flash in the pan
Mark is trying to ride a big wheel of thin glass
We gotta go clear the road that might take us to the "crystal ship."
Could it take us to the place we all heard about ?
Maybe this man standing outside is not a real watchman...
Again I got this stress by knowing it
Every time I over-realise
I'm far from my freedom I dream about
True enough to face these walls I can't jump
No! They just keep coming closer
Continuous visions of too many kinds
Home, is that you waiting for my
Wide spread arms running to your
Joyful yard ?
Joyful yard... joyful yard...
No! They just keep coming closer
Continuous visions of too many kinds
Home, is that you waiting for my
Wide spread arms running to your
Joyful yard ?
Huh... a few for goodnight!
Gone but still observed as an insane man
Looking forward to Sundays drowned in your eyes
Looking forward to Sundays drowned in your eyes
Still looking forward to Sundays drowned in your eyes
