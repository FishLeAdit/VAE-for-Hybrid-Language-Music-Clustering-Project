The way you move makes me stop!
My mind is hard, my brain is soft
I tried to speak, but I cannot talk
I'm frozen, but it's so hot, I'm on!
Baby, baby, oh baby, yeah
I, I, oh, goddman!
I tried to hold you, but you're like sand
Slipping through these broken of mine
I feel you slipping away
I feel you slipping away
I feel you slipping away
I feel you slipping away
Oh, I feel, yeah, I feel
I feel you slipping away!
