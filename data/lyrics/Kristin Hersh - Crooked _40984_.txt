Hold the flashlight under your chin
Closer as the lights dim
You lonely doll
You lucky dog
You lonely doll
You lucky dog
You free fall
Down to the living room
Closer as the lights dim
Spread the glitter on your pillow
Count your blessings on your fingers
Crawl your way back down the stairs
Down to the living room
Closer as the lights dim
Glittering
In lazy boys and Christmas lights
Glittering
Then found a dark body
To the right and crooked
And crooked
