Colorblind
Seems like I've been using someone’s eyes
Can't recall the love that I’m after
Broken nose
Pay for all the chances you’re supposed to have

If I could then I'll try a hundred times before
To get through the absence of seeing distant shores
I wonder if I change the colors throughout her
The world could be your fantasy

I've dreamt through days with hostile memories
Differences you make up between us
Honeycombs
Ice cream melts the bottoms of your toes
Turning malice into affection

You always were eager to dig into the sand
While I was dreaming of holding your hand
If we hide under the covers together
The world could be your fantasy
