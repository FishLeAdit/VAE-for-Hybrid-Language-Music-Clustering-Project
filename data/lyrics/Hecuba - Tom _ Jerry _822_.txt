You're a gaudy masterpiece

Come into my life
In digital 3D
Actual 3D
But your mountain of stone
Is hardly a home
Till your finally alone
I guess you'll never no
No no
Pack it up
Stack it up
Brick by brick
Tick tock
Tick tock
Tick tock
Tick tock
And you just don't stop
And you just won't stop
Blood on the tracks
Freedom ahead
Im keeping track
My freedom's ahead
Oooh
You got my hanging like a chandelier
Catching the light with a crystal tear
You got me living in the living room
You got me dining in the dining room
But the last supper was ate
Uh huh
Uh huh
Blood on the tracks
Freedoms ahead
Im keeping track
My freedoms ahead
Um ah
Things get bumpy eyes get black
I try to leave
Hes after me
Like im the mouse and hes the cat
Im the mouse and hes the cat
Hes

Tom
And Im his Jerry
