I wonder is it vain enough
To be thinking about traitors in her armies true
Has this battle been fought and won over many times?
If we're still alive and maidens that means something
Old hearts and hands join in
Surround this pyre
Burning chants and wishes fade
And rotten dreams escaping over the wreckage
Wounded boiling gardens
Swamps of poison
I don't miss this kiss of treachery

Goddamn you
Graceless lady
Get off of my shoes
Goddamn you

How a lost thing detaches in mid-stride
Of purpose is the action
The carrier moves on
Unknowingly and coldly
Until he reaches his own destination
Taken for granted alone they both weep forgotten
Waterfalls I wept against time and nature
Loving humanity
Is this the only thing that prevails?

Goddamn you
Graceless lady
Get off of my shoes
Goddamn you

Piles of spoiling treats around you
Water seeping through foundations 
Would turn us all in-inside out
Kissing the lovers with a piece held upright into mesh
Unfold, turn into high pressure time
For the future isn't what it used to be
Dying among our possessions
Choking on each other

Goddamn you
Graceless lady
Stepping on my shoes
Goddamn you
Graceless lady

Goddamn you
Graceless lady
Get off of my shoes
Goddamn you
