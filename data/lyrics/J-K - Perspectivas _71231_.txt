Ladies and gentlemen, King Madi

So, how long we 'gone keep staring at each other from across the building? (We can play this all night, girl)
And act like we don't feel all this tension in the room
You can't help but keep it at the surface
'Cause you don't wanna sink into me, when I'm talking to you, but you know
You ain't got nothing else better to do
I can see it in your eyes, they sparkle when I'm with you, ooh
Baby, I ain't giving you no ultimatum (Nah, nah)
I got options, even right now, I'm just tryna weight 'em (Yah, yah)
But if we're gonna do this, baby I love hard (I love hard)
So keep your distance if you know you're not down for (Not down for)
The type of passion that I bring, I give you my all
'Causе when I'm with you baby, temporary ain't what it's for, or--

I feel, like I know how you see mе, but baby, what's your point of view?
'Cause I've been, watching all the little things, just tryna make my way to you

I need to know your PERSPECTIVE
Baby, let me know your PERSPECTIVE
'Cause I'm ready to go all in
I know how I see you, but it's so hard to read you
Baby, I really need to know your PERSPECTIVE, yeah

Yeah, I need to know your PERSPECTIVE
I'm so tired of the guessing, I'm so tired of the tension
Why're we acting like we too good for each other, baby?
Well maybe just feel like we don't deserve one another
Lately I've been saying fuck it, and doing things that I normally wouldn't do
And I've gotta make the first move in this game
The past few months, I've felt way more than enough pain
So I can't take it personal, if this ends in vain
We're either going all the way, or just separate ways, yeah
Baby, I don't mean to pressure you
'Cause you know I feel the pressure too
But I can't sit here and wait on you, got other shit I need to do
Got me feeling like John Goldberg, with the way I be watching You
Borderline stalking you, but it don't feel wrong 'cause you're watching too

I feel, like I know how you see me, but baby, what's your point of view?
'Cause I've been, watching all the little things, just tryna make my way to you

I need to know your PERSPECTIVE
Baby, let me know your PERSPECTIVE
'Cause I'm ready to go all in
I know how I see you, but it's so hard to read you
Baby, I really need to know your PERSPECTIVE
I need to know your PERSPECTIVE
Baby, let me know your PERSPECTIVE
'Cause I'm ready to go all in
I know how I see you, but it's so hard to read you
Baby, I really need to know your PERSPECTIVE, yeah

I feel, like I know how you see me, but baby, what's your point of view?
'Cause I've been, watching all the little things, just tryna make me way to you

King Madi, Haley, yeah, MATRIX
