I only want to lie down here
I see red lights right in front of me
They aren't tongues of fire
It's my only desire
You better give up
You can scream, shrinking my mind
You can beat me, I don’t feel the pain
You can hunt me down in fire
Now you make me lose everything
Every touch to your skin is one step to perfect sin
Every beat of your heart brings me back to the start
You can scream, shrinking my mind
You can beat me, I don’t feel the pain
You can hunt me down in fire
Now you make me lose everything
