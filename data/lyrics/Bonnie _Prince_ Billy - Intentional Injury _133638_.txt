In time you find your way to release
And then it goes away, again
What had been the strongest force against you
Becomes your only friend
You can't help but laugh
And I own your soul
A shadow unwanted by any on earth
Most of us rejoice at your awful crying
We live to force you to regret your own birth
Sky falls, ground is gone
Our lord is uplifting
Your work has dissolved
The balance of life is shifting
No way to lose, there is no way to lose
Can't lose your way when there is no way
We, we fight what had been your home
And all of your power becomes ours today
Sky falls, ground is gone
Our lord is uplifting
Your work has dissolved
The balance of life is shifting
