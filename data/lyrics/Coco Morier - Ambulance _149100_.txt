Please tell someone to cut off the life machine
Let that long note ring on the EKG
There's no medicine, science hasn't found remedy
Please tell someone to cut off the life machine

Slings and braces try to fix what's torn apart
They can't erase the pain inflicted on my heart
Fade to black, fade to black, fade to black, fade to black
Too late to call the ambulance for my heart

Can't let go of you, time's not helping me heal
Crashed my car and you're still there spinning the wheel
I need medicine but I haven't found remedy, bring you back to me
Took the anesthetic but I can still feel

Slings and braces try to fix what's torn apart
They can't erase the pain inflicted on my heart
Fade to black, fade to black, fade to black, fade to black
Too late to call the ambulance for my heart
