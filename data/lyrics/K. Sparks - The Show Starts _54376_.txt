Silence! Now listen

I'm a Show Up Queen
Show you what I mean
'Cause I'm in these streets--

Jan's got something to say
Everybody jokes I'm so nice nice nice
But I love me so I don't think twice
I'm real, it's how I feel
My positive outlook you just can't steal
I'm peppy peppy peppy, that's my energy
Want it all the time, that's how I be
So get out of my head and shake my junk
You know what Mama Ru said "Bring my funk!"

It's the box that rocks!
They call you a freak
For thinking that you're meek
Stand with me and be proud
Time to shine and get lo-lo-lo-loud
Laugh with me and they'll see
You the queen they wanna be
Ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha, bitch!

Hey! This ain't just a lot of talk
You know we gon' walk the walk
When they ring answer the call

I'm a Show Up Queen
Show you what I mean
'Cause I'm in these streets
Better show up, queen
Better make a scene
Till they listenin'

Listen up, I got something to say
Wake up, wake up and I'm feeling away
Gotta shake this thing, here's what I say
I'm good, I'm worthy, I was born to be great
Don't let no self-doubt get up in my way
It's all right, you okay, don't stay in that place
Feel your feelings, have your moment
Then you throw it away
Do what your grandmama taught you
And let your light lead the way

Ooh, chile! I guess it's my turn
Let me introduce myself, I'm TKB
I'm a bad mama-jama from the South
Started from the bottom now I'm in the lead
If you blink I'm gon' end up with the crown
I've overcome depression, I'm living in my truth
If it can happen for me, well, it can happen for you
I'ma lead, I'ma fight, I'ma speak up for what's right
Positivity is fierce when you know your status, right?

Hey! This ain't just a lot of talk
You know we gon' walk the walk
When they ring answer the call

I'm a Show Up Queen
Show you what I mean
'Cause I'm in these streets
Better show up, queen
Better make a scene
Till they listenin'

I'ma show up, show up
Then I'll show 'em up some more
Know what, know what?
Hit you when I'm out the door

I'm a Show Up Queen
Show you what I mean
'Cause I'm in these streets--

You know we show up, we stand up
We got stuff we stand up for too
Let's do it, girl
Ooh, I'll tell you what
When they down I'm standing up

Eureka, loud, five hundred pounds and proud
Hahaha!
More than my size or the standard of beauty
Took me thirty-mh-mh years just to know that I'm worthy
Haters stop and say she's polarizing
But baby, I wake up and started realizing
Growth is the word, no need to panic
Equal rights and self-love is the true pandemic
Size 16, never gonna lose
Kick to the sky even in potato shoes

Glamour Toad coming through!
I was a short fat kid with a real limp wrist
Held all of my emotions in a balled up fist
I didn't wanna speak with my sissy lisp
Chubby, gay and country, well, I think you get the gist
I didn't wanna show up 'cause I knew that I'd be dissed
But if I didn't show up look at what y'all would've missed
Who'd have thought I'd grow up to accomplish all of this
Now my haters all are pissed so kiss my grits

Hey! This ain't just a lot of talk
You know we gon' walk the walk
When they ring answer the call

Ooh, I'll tell you what
When they down I'm standing up
Ooh, no matter what
When they call I'm showing up, yeah yeah--

You better giddy up or giddy out
Showing up y'all and I'm doing it with style
Stomping in stiletto heels and I'm slaying every mile
When I'm driven by my ego I got all my feelings hurt
Took a bite of humble pie now I'm putting in the work
Gotta keep my head up, try dancing with the rain
'Cause there's a whole lot of beauty waiting after all the pain
I'm a queen on my way, keep growing in my glow up
And they all best believe I'm showing out when I show up

Hey! This ain't just a lot of talk
You know we gon' walk the walk
When they ring answer the call

Ooh, I'll tell you what
When they down I'm standing up
Ooh, no matter what
When they call I'm showing up, yeah yeah

I'ma show up, show up
Then I'll show 'em up some more
Know what, know what?
Hit you when I'm out the door
Ooh, I'll tell you what
When they call I'm showing up, yeah yeah

United we stand, divided we fall
So let's do this thing together
One more time!

I'm a Show Up Queen
Ooh, I'll tell you what
Show you what I mean
When they down I'm standing up
Better show up, queen
Ooh, no matter what
Better make a scene
When they call I'm showing up, yeah yeah

I'ma show up, show up
Then I'll show 'em up some more
Know what, know what?
Hit you when I'm out the door

I'm a Show Up Queen
Ooh, I'll tell you what
Show you what I mean
When they call I'm showing up, yeah yeah

I'm a Show Up Queen, yeah yeah
