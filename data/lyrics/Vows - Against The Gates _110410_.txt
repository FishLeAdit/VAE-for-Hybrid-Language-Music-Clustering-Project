I left my better parts hanging in dead air
I took a look around but there was nothing to spare
There was nothing to spare
I have a memory that will never fade
That lasts longer than what you have to say
We never made it but we pressed up against the gates
We left some footprints we could follow at a later date
Follow at a later date
I have a memory that will never fade
That lasts longer than what you have to say
