Give me your hand and I'll give you mine
Follow me and my bottle of wine
And we'll dance 'neath the stars, dance 'neath the stars
Haven't got a care, breathing country air
Holding hands with you, this is a memory we'll share
Tell me secrets and tell me your dreams
I'll tell stories of my various schemes
I love clowning around, clowning around
I have my whole life long, I'll keep it going on
Every day I make someone laugh so hard
That they cry out tears and their stomach's hard
As I dance with you, I'll make you laugh too
And you'll finally see I make you happy
This is a fantasy, it's true
Let us giggle and look at the lake
Hope I'll see that your smile ain't fake
Life is a dream, life is a dream
Nothing can go wrong, nothing can go wrong
We'll catch frogs and sit on logs and our night will last long
Every day I make someone laugh so hard
That they cry out tears and their stomach's hard
As I dance with you, I'll make you laugh too
And you'll finally see I make you happy
This is a fantasy, it's true
Give me your hand and I'll give you mine
Follow me and my bottle of wine
And we'll dance 'neath the stars, dance 'neath the stars
Haven't got a care, breathing country air
Holding hands with you, this is a memory we'll share
