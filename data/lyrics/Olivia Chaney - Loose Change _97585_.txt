He came, he went
He conquered her that night
Before he took flight
Chauffeured from responsibility

Competitive child
Beneath a fertile chestnut tree
Even when she tied his laces
He did not thank me

Swinging her best shot, he retold his bad jokes
Side-by-side on the pavement
Lost his phone heading home
His tail between their legs

She waved him farewell
Behind wound-up, tinted glass
Could not return from whence they came
Open sky would only cause more pain

So she took the high road
With the launderettes
Betting shops
With the Orthodox

Bought rollmops for her friend
As the klezmer band marched on
Took the coins, politely ran
Conviction in her hand like change

Loose change
She hears that same refrain, but loosely changed

It lands, you leave
Regain, recede
Disbelief suspends the match
Fuels her every sense

He wills her, bare nerves
Worn to the edge
Scores a bed notch, pound of flesh
Yet swore to return

Bound in chains
We hear that same refrain
