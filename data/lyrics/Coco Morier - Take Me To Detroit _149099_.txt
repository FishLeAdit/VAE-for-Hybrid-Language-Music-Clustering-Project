I miss New York, the good old days are long past
The party ended as soon as the streets were cleared off the trash
I miss the "A" Train and the ride to Rockaway Avenue
There's nothing left here to destroy
So take me to Detroit
Take me to Detroit

I don't feel right, there's no bite in The Big Apple
Tried to fight but I wish I could just time travel
Back to Lou Reed and Nico going bananas
Not this fashion label pretty punk manufactured
Maybe there's still some grit in the motor city
Cheap house to rent, I'll cover it in graffiti
I'll demolish dance floors in the birthplace of techno
'Cause I can't hang in Williamsburg just drinking Prosecco

I miss New York, the good old days are long past
The party ended as soon as the streets were cleared off the trash
I miss the "A" Train and the ride to Rockaway Avenue
There's nothing left here to destroy
So take me to Detroit
Take me to Detroit

Where's the S&M bars like the movie Cruising
Wish I could hit my head, wake up desperately seeking Susan
But I'll never be back, no matter how much I wanna
'Cause there never ever can be another Madonna
It used to feel like the center of the world
The place where freaks could go and the boys could be girls
From the b-boys in the Bronx
To the jazz joints in Harlem
The city never sleeps
That's how every dream started

I miss New York, the good old days are long past
The party ended as soon as the streets were cleared off the trash
I miss the "A" Train and the ride to Rockaway Avenue
There's nothing left here to destroy
So take me to Detroit
Take me to Detroit
