Someone screwed up about half past the line
Wish I'd been up, I could have had a blast and then run
But I know now, there's that one person everyone has
That messed them up, and they're still thinking about them

They're everywhere
They're everywhere

Between the booze, Bob goes go out and have fun
Now nodding off, I know I should've listened to him
I know now that I'm not half as bad as I thought
It's everyone, and I feel better knowing that

We're everywhere
We're everywhere
We're everywhere
We're everywhere
