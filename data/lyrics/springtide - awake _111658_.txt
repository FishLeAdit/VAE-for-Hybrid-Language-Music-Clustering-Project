Springfield-Bissonette
So nice to meet you
So good to see your friendly face
Living in shadows
I was walking around without a safety net
Finding a breakthrough
Try to outrun the human race
Sleeping with voodoo
I opened my eyes and I saw your face
You showed me there’s a place
Where I am wide awake
I’m wide awake
The mountains shift to my earthquake
And everyone is my friend
I’m wide awake
So wide awake
The future’s bright and lined with light
And I am free to be a kid again
One hand on the throttle
But I always had one hand on the break
Under the spotlight
I was never alone but I always was by myself
I want to be famous
Willing to sleep with a rattlesnake
Looking for daylight
Trying to wake up from this nightmare screaming
You showed me my mistake
And now I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake
The rain parks fall, it conquers all
And everyone is my friend
I’m wide awake
So ever wide awake
The future’s bright and lined with light
I can see you’re graceful
I could always be your hopeless kiss
And if I didn’t learn to bend
You know that I would break
Now I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake
The mountains shift to my earthquake
And everyone is my friend
I’m wide awake
So wide awake
The future’s bright and lined with light
And I am free to be a kid again
I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake
The rain parks fall, it conquers all
And everyone is my friend
(And everyone is my friend)
And everyone is my friend
(And everyone is my friend)
And I am free to be a kid again
