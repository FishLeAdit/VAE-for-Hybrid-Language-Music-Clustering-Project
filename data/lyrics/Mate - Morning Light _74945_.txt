So I guess we’re really doing this
My dog sleeps by my side
I guess we’ll try to make a go of it
Throw some wood onto the fire
And I don’t know if I’ll be any good
And I don’t know if the right time’s now
And I don’t know if we even should
But there’s only one way that we both find out
So I guess we crossed the line tonight
The fire it still glows
Things are clearer in the morning light
And we can take it slow
And I don’t know if I’ll be any good
And I don’t know if the right time’s now
And I don’t know if we even should
But there’s only onе way that we both find out
