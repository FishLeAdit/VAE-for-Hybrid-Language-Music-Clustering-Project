Selling all these damn bricks, I might lose my mind
Ain't nobody gave me shit, I had to grind, grind, grind
You can't sacrifice this shit, you won't need your shine
Fuck it, will flip my whole wrist 'cause I don't needs the time
Selling all these damn zips, I might lose my mind
Ain't nobody gave me shit, I had to grind, grind, grind
You can't sacrifice this shit, then you won't need your shine
Fuck it, will flip my whole wrist 'cause I don't needs the time

Ain't got no time, I'm impatient
For my neck and my bracelet
Slug  31
Like I play for the Pacers
.223's, Reggie Miller
Stomp you in some Margielas
I got choppers, they're metal
I ain't worried 'bout my rebels
Basic bitch used to play me
Now I ball on the daily
And my bitches are dimes
But all my nines be my fragrance
I be styling and dripping
I be smoking and sipping
She be calling me, tripping
You watch your mouth, get some business
I got snow like Mount Everest
Got them cookies, my preference
 like the 
Got rich and they jealous
Get  from Benjis
And Ferraris and Bentleys
Gotta walk with extensions
'Cause one day, they might tempt me
56 to a quarter-P
Young nigga got the recipe
Hundred rounds on the .223
Chopper kick like Bruce Lee
Chopper hit like Bruce Wayne
Oh, they mad 'cause I do my thing
JJ gone and still bring pain
Trapping the rap game, no Cain

Selling all these damn bricks, I might lose my mind
Ain't nobody gave me shit, I had to grind, grind, grind
You can't sacrifice this shit, you won't need your shine
Fuck it, will flip my whole wrist 'cause I don't needs the time
Selling all these damn zips, I might lose my mind
Ain't nobody gave me shit, I had to grind, grind, grind
You can't sacrifice this shit, then you won't need your shine
Fuck it, will flip my whole wrist 'cause I don't needs the time

Wearing Margielas, stepping on a key
Roll up my sleeves, about to wear a P
He not the plug, who the fuck is he?
I got the trapping shit to a science
I just dropped this bill to the client
 plug at the 
J's had them going along the tractor trailer
Just bought a couple drums for the haters
Walking dispensary, I got different flavors
I go to Cali, 
I go to Denver, girls, they gonna cater
I keep a chopper for niggas who crazy
I  nigga couldn't save her
Unless y'all the fucking nigga like 
I brought the draco with me just to 
I could tell the wolves gone, had to eat them
These niggas petty, they ain't trying to win
Should got a heart of OG Zen
That ain't the money muddy, that's a 
I'm a  nigga 
I turned like $50 cash into a M
He fuck around and I'ma shoot at him
They fuck around and I'ma shoot at them
Just hit the truck driver out west
Find me a great plug, I was blessed
My only goal was to get a check
Car had a sit-down with the connect
Secrets so low, you niggas can't believe it
Just flew to San Fran for a meeting
Just so the dollar bill 
Just for some fire OG and a blunt

Selling all these damn bricks, I might lose my mind
Ain't nobody gave me shit, I had to grind, grind, grind
You can't sacrifice this shit, you won't need your shine
Fuck it, will flip my whole wrist 'cause I don't needs the time
Selling all these damn zips, I might lose my mind
Ain't nobody gave me shit, I had to grind, grind, grind
You can't sacrifice this shit, then you won't need your shine
Fuck it, will flip my whole wrist 'cause I don't needs the time
