I'm sick of you hangin’ around
I'm sick of lies spread all over town
This time you went too far
Now I know who you really are

You're the chick who’d mess with my head
Ancient one who recently said
"Yeah I know we should hang out
Yeah, for sure, without a doubt"

I'm sick of all the things that you say
You can take your dog and just walk away
Here and there, with all your great plans
Up and down, I know where you stand

You're the chick who'd mess with my head
Ancient one who recently said
"Yeah I know we should hang out
Yeah, for sure, without a doubt"

I'm sick of you hangin' around
I'm sick of lies spread all over town
This time you went too far
Now I know who you really are

You're the chick who’d mess with my head
Ancient one who recently said
"Yeah I know we should hang out
Yeah, for sure, without a doubt"
