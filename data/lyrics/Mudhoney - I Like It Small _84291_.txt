I like it, I like it, I like it small
I like it, I like it, I like it small
I'm not on so greedios trip
I'm fine with little sips
I'm good with ladders, sams and piffs
Now let me go down the list
Memo production, low years
Intimate settings, living it up appeals
Dinget basements, showing ones
No expectations, wait I'm not done!
I like it, I like it, I like it small
I like it, I like it, I like it small
I don't need no magnum
A snub nose would do just fine
And I'll take gg allan
Over long dong silver any time
And when I orgy, I capital 12
Going forth and I get overwhelmed
Don't you swear the little things
I like to try to sweep them in
I keep em tucked, in my fist
What they might be, you can only guess
And when I show my hand
You will finally understand
That I've got big enough balls
To admit that I like it small
I like it, I like it, I like it small
I like it, I like it, I like it small
I like it, I like it, I like it small
I like it, I like it, I like it small
