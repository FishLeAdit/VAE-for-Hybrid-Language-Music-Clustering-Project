If I hand you the baked potatoes
For laters
Would you stable those spuds
Beside you, inside you?
Ma'am your stable seems so invitin'
For bidin' time
And for those of you so enlightened
I'm frightened
I sat and ate straw by the barn
Rain fell down
The wind is blowing very hard
I look all around for you
Need life be a hall of phases
In blazes?
Why must I be another farmhand
In harmland?
I see you by the summer gate
I come down
That's when you really laid the bait
I fell in your pool
Here's the savior I'm not behaving
I'm raving
Fear I ain't got no time to play with
Or stay with
