The big lights downtown are impressive
I think I'll take a walk
I see you're on discount but I don't trust it
We have to have a talk

I start to like you
Your blonde hair
You were laughing like you didn't care
Used to be precise
That's how I knew
I could afford you
Pay your extra

Got your window
At a brick wall
On a hot night
Can you keep a secret between your loose lips?
And do you bite?

A movement so fast
It's hard to tell
And there's no reason that you're not feeling well
To be precise
That's how I knew
I could afford you
Pay your extra due

Why don't you come down
From your high ledgе?
Ooh, don't get upset
If we don't show up on timе
Know they're gonna love us

I think you like me too much
Guess you had to go
At least we didn't hear you 
Guess that I was right
It's probably true
I could afford you
Pay your extra due
Why don't you come down?
