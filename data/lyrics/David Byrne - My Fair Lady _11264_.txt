Look, is this the real thing?
When you caught my eye
How you looked at me, from the pages of a magazine
Now you're always, always on my mind
Every color, line and feature
Never age and never tire
In my sleep and in my dreams at night
Calls to me a strange attraction
With your beauty and your passion
You are art and art will never change
Such a perfect replica
Every pore and hair
Every pencil mark
You're such a perfect imitation of
And that it seems, seems you're almost here
Evеry color, line and feature
Nеver age and never tire
In my sleep and in my dreams at night
Calls to me a strange attraction
With your beauty and your passion
You are art and art will never change
You are just an illustration
This is just a simulation
Lines and pixels on a piece of paper
You can see me slowly changing
But forever you'll remaining
And you have time because you will live forever
Every color, line and feature
Never age and never tire
In my sleep and in my dreams at night
Calls to me strange attraction
With your beauty and your passion
You are art and art will never change
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
