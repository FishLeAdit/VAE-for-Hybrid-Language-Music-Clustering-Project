I've been so in love
I stutter as my life unfolds
Don't ask, you won't be told
You broke the promise
I'm lying on the floor tonight
To dream of all
Those empty memories
Of singing on that carousel
We'd ride together
Hey Mother, hey hey Mother
Why do you cry?
Tell me what the birds have said about my father
Hey Father, hey hey Father
What do you know?
Lovers on the carousel won't ride forever
I walk the ocean
I'm looking through kaleidoscopes to see the colors
Don't say you saw writing on the walls
If you believe that simple words will make a difference
Sick sick my heart
Sick sick my heart
I want to die, so that I
Can stop this crying
