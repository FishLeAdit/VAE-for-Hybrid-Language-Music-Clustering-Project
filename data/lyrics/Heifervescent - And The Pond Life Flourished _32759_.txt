A picture of you, a smile and a bong
We’re laughing together and singing an old fashioned song
Then something went wrong
You pushed me into the pond,under the ice
What were you thinking? I’ve already been baptised
Now that wasn’t nice
Since you’ve been gone, I’ve been safe, I’ve been sound, I’ve been good
All those magical times that we shared are al tainted with mud
No good
You tied up my hands, and gave me a smile
Attached me to your car, and dragged me for miles and miles
I’ve got to say, you destroyed me in style
Such a deadly smile
Pain, fading away, healing with time
Pain, fading away, healing with time
Since you’ve been gone, I’ve been safe, I’ve been sound, I’ve been good
All those magical times that we shared are al tainted with mud
No good
