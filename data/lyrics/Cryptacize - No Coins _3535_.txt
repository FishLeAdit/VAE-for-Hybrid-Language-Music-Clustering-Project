No coins, no coins
We'll never have any
But I, but I
Was sure there'd be plenty

This garden will always be bare
Without any supper seeds
How can anything grow
With all that we owe?

No coins, no coins
We'll never have any
Not a plant nor a penny

This garden will always be bare
Without any supper seeds
How can anything grow
With all that we owe?

Wind blow, wind blow
Carry us to where you go
Buried until it's time to grow
