Open lips and loosened fist
You come before me
Come before me
Powdered nose and soon you
Go to please the pullings
Pulling swiftly
Tired limbs and softened wings
You've tied too tightly
Come beside me
Ribbons fall and feathers breathe
And learn to widen
Do not fear them
I am stolen from whispered firelight
This I am, this I am
Holy dust from the breath before time
Here I stand, here I stand
What will you do when your blinders fade
Not a trace of what caught you
Just the trail from what brought you
What will you see when you're face to face
Curving lines coming undone
That whole life leading up to this one
