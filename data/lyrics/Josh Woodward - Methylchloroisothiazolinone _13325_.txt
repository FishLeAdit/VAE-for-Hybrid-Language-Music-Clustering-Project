The cold fever, a cellular germ
The stray tingle, a chemical burn
Go away, go away, cuz I don't wanna see you
The same cycle, everyday
This sick head, gonna wash it away
Go away, go away, go away
You make me feel so clean
You make me kick and scream
You make me, you make me
You make me feel so clean
A snap, crackle, a fizzling sound
My skin itches and twitches around
Go away, go away, cuz I don't wanna feel you
My pulse races and wanders astray
This sick head, gonna burn it away
Go away, go away, go away

I lather and rinse and repeat
You leave me feeling complete
Go away, go away, cuz I don't wanna keep you
I lather and rinse and repeat
You leave me feeling complete
Go away, go away, go away
