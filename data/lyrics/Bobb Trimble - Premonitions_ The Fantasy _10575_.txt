Premonitions are running wild
'Cause you're in my dreams tonight
As I lie there close by your side
I can see our futures sparkle with every twinkle of your eyes

Of your eyes
Of your eyes
With every twinkle of your eyes, boy

Sing me a chorus from your heart
I'll accompany you on my trusted guitar
You can surrender your life to me
And I'll sing your every song, you'll sing my every harmony

Harmony
Harmony
I'll sing your every harmony
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If there's a song in your heart, let me play it
If there's a thought in your mind, please, please say it
If there's a void in your life, I will fill it
If there's a dream you need, I'll will it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

For you're the song in my heart so true to the end
It's only you, my finely-tuned friend
And it's upon your love which I do depend
'Til my every last breath, it's you I will defend
I will defend, I will defend
I will defend, I will defend, yeah
'Cause you know your rights I will defend
And it's upon your love which I do depend
'Til my every last breath, it's you I will defend
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Premonitions are running wild
'Cause you're in my dreams tonight
As I lie there close by your side
I can see our futures sparkle with every twinkle of your eyes

Of your eyes
Of your eyes
With every twinkle of your eyes, boy
With every twinkle of your eyes
With every twinkle of your eyes, boy
With every twinkle of your eyes
