Wise men walk without seeing
Fine men will do without speaking
Shy men meet me in the morning
Shy men meet me by the window
Blind men see without seeing
By then, and now I'm changing
Shy men meet me at the morning
Shy men greet me by the window
My friends teach me what they're learning
My friends hate it when I'm hurting
Shy men meet me at the morning
Shy men wake me in the morning
Shy men
Meet me at the morning
I live without thinking
