These boys are torn and tired
They used to burn so bright
They staggered into love or sin one night
Turn down that light
All of their battles are happy
And all of their songs are sad
Confusion of slow novas
Burning clear and fade away
Confusion of slow novas
Drifting away drifting away
Their life is like no other
Their world is like no one
They wandered out to scream and shout and run
Forever young
Those boys are torn and tired
They used to burn so bright
They staggered into love or sin one night
Turn down that light
