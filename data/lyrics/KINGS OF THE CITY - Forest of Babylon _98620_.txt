A man with a fictitious grin pondered the terrain in which he flooded with anguish
For this is England, and the lion cannot be tamed, this is the game
Ha, yo

I was thinking with my dick and then this chick was like "I love you as a friend"
And then it had to end, and that's pretty much the way the world works with men
But fuck an employer 'cause I'm raggo to the end
In the Endz, we're still tryna fight habits
Life's quite tragic, chasing the white rabbit
I'm the type that just might have it, so every Friday night my eyes are fucked
Brain truly worn, filled with the scorn
I get high till I see purple unicorns with nine millimeter uzi horns in forties movie form
'Cause the duty of misusing stupid floozies got me bored
I'm just waiting for the summer to barbecue the corn (Ha)
And as I journey through the forest, that's the only time, that I'm completely honest
This world is a game, not made for a novice
If this girl is my dame, well then I'll make the promise (Ha)

And in cold blood I killed them
The ones I love, my children
Their tiny hands played music
Only I could hear
So clear to me, to me

I was thinking with my dick and then this chick was like "Ken I'm pregnant"
That's when the call ended, 'cause even though less protection can make me more tempted
It was April the 1st, shout me tomorrow if you meant it
I'm just laying a verse, praying it works, if not I'll write another one
Lie ability to speak truth 'cause I'm kinda troublesome, uh
Look what my Mother done she raised a menace
A Bourne Legacy my identity ain't just Kenneth
Instead it's this fucked up kid with a flagrant mouth
Some think it's crazy how my perfect day is playing Fifa Online
And getting head while I'm sorting formations out
I quit blazing now I'm a future alcoholic
Ironic 'cause since 2001ish I blame the chronic
For making me flow sicker than infinite baby vomit
I'm on it, no sleep I'll never relax (Ha)
Well, at least until I relapse

And in cold blood I killed them
The ones I love, my children
Their tiny hands played music
Only I could hear
So clear to me, to me
