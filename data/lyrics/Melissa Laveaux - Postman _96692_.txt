I've got a postman knocking daily on my door
He claims he brings news from heaven's floor
He caters to the young, caters to the poor
But the love of the Sun is all I can afford

It's better than what I thought
It's better than what I thought
It's better than what I thought I had before
It's better than what I thought I had before, before

No word from my kin, my own words ignored
I tried bleeding out the pain that I had stored
I give love to those who can afford
Between my legs a jewel labours till it's sore

Redemption is lost on me
Redemption is lost on me
Redemption is lost on me, lost child of the lord
Redemption is lost on me, lost child of the lord, of the lord

I have a postman knocking daily on my door
No clue what he claims to be bringing forth
Stuck under my nails, hidden in my pores
I fear he'll scratch out the pain I've adored

Redemption is lost on me
Redemption is lost on me
Redemption is lost on me, lost child of the lord
Redemption is lost on me, lost child of the lord, of the lord
