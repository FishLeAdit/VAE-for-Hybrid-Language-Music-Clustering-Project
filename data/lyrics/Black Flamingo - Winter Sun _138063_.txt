Everything is black, air, water, sun, moon, all light, dirt is black
Heav'n is in mourning for our Son
The earth is dead: it will rise again, Almighty God
Now I understand what light is: it is our Son
It is Jesus, no longer trembling in my arms: it is the Christ
Oh my boy: Jesus, my first and only one
Now on my knees with Joseph at my side, I ask Thee: send the resurrection now
Give the air and water and sun and moon and the dirt; thy light again
Send the presence Almighty God, send it even to evil men
I see Jesus in the clouds, oh, free Him from death for life:
We must be free to sing:
Loose the birds for their songs
Bloom the flow'rs for their songs
Light Martha, whose brother came back from death
Light Mary Magdalene, light Gethsemane's gardens:
Light those walkways with lilies, and heal the wounds of Christ
Let me rise up into your starry sky and love our Son, and praise thee
Ah, comfort me in paradise
