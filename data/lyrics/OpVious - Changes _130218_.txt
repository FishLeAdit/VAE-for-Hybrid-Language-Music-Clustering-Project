Verse 1:
I remember those days
Lil’ kid chilling, I would play with my toys
Pokémon villains, gotta’ tame them boys
Built friendships, but I had to let go(Lego)
Growing up quick
That’s the thing that stays yo
Same with thing with my mojo
Left with a few real that I know /
So lets go
To time where we had silly horrors
Roaming the woods like explorers
Conquer the beasts right before us
Talking bout’ pretty girls in our fortress
And man not a worry in world-blind to it all
Till’ I grow tall, I won’t bust my nerve
But that time’s here, and I got the call
Say hello to this place that’s called earth
Hook:
(Mmm!)
We'll go through all these changes, walk these places
To next chapter, flip the pages
Yeah I know this
We'll just go through all these stages
I don’t get down I feel amazing

Verse 2:
I’m feeling superman, can't(kent) feel another way
Buddha stance has me wishing I could levitate
Blunts at glance, has me thinking to elaborate
I'm just trying find my place, fam
On this road, that’s not close to home
Reaching to some places that are way beyond
What about this style, will they give their nods
I’ll just do my thing try to beat the odds
Two cents for toss, sentiments in vault
Opened up for all, so you could see my flaws
I might go to mars the way I rocket
I’m the only pilot, zooming by in my spaceship
I just landed, another planet
With the colors on my palette
Picasso, my talent, so scratch where I've been
Only matters where we headin'
When I was teen, I felt lost in the universe
Yet I still feel so lost in the universe
But I was losing hope, for my place in the universe
Now I see how I belong in the universe
Didn't know everything was connected yeah
Didn't know I was sleeping through my life yeah
Now I hope, we could make some good changes yeah
So let's grow, cuz that’s we came for yeah
Hook:
(Mmm!)
So many places, so many changes
Just gotta face it, we’ll go through these stages
Onto the next chapter, just flippin these pages
So many changes, but I think that we'll get through them
So many changes, yeah I know I that we'll get through them
