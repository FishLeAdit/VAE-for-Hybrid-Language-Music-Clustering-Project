Grace, I watched you sleeping
All worn out and dreaming
You slept through the fall
I know you love this time of year
It always made you smile
Grace, I watched you breathing
All quiet and peaceful
But you were so weak
When I left that night I somehow knew
Your patient heart was finally through
But I never cried
I never cried
Everything falls for a reason
Gravity pulls it to earth
Everyone to a season
Everything falls into place
Witness the fall of Grace
Grace, none of us blamed you
Nobody shamed you
When we laid you down
Everyone was there, you know
Your folks, your friends, and me
But I never cried
I never cried
