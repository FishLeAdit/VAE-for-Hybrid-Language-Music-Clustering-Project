1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Do it!
Word to the mothership
Yeah we're on some other shit
Now is not the time to quit
U See my soul
It chose this path
I won't back down
I've done the math
I'll steadily improve my craft
F*ck ignorance and race and class
Protect us from psychic attack
The odds against us cannot stack
If everyone has every back
Lack of respect is really wack
You wanna move I'll help you pack
Please don't be rude just stay on track
You cannot sell my tits and ass
I'm thinkin' soon you'll feel the wrath
From a god outside of us
The biggest lie in god we trust
You cannot see corrupted thrust
Powers that be are greed and lust
Word to the mothership
Yeah we're on some other shit
Now is not the time to quit
Mayans told us bout the shift
Please do not fear this is our gift
We aren't alone put down that splif
Slow down your roll and don't get stiff
Get steady and connect with earth
She will ground to the place of birth
We won't compete we'll share the turf
Please do not question what you're worth
Yeah I got plans and I will scheme to fill each man with a light beam
I know you'll think that I'm extreme, I am fire know what I mean
And you will not need to redeem your coupon you are on my team
My heart is bustin' at the seam
Come on inside be in my dream
Word to the mothership
Yeah we're on some other shit
Now is not the time to quit
We are divine create our life
Stopped eatin' swine took out the knife
Put in my back cause I got twice
Now that's a fact I payed a price
A little love it will suffice
I got the sass, sugar and spice
Gave you a pass now please be nice
Love everyone from men to mice
Word to the mothership
Yeah were on some other shit
Now is not the time to quit
