Slowly
I ran
Through rain
At last
I'm here
But I can hear
That the party's not there

Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)
Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)
Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)
Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)
Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)
Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)
Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)
Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)

Slowly
I ran
To shore
At last
My boat
Set afloat
But the wind is not there

Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)
Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)
Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)
Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)
Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)
Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)
Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)
Wash my dreams away (Wash my dreams away)
