I know where I wouldn't go back as much as where to go
Being unfaithful to my principles, I don't want to end you
And to you who has too much, you don't like to share
And to me who's always needing, I've given you everything
I've changed the finding myself to not give up on you
And I've changed all of my steps to see you walk
Truth always hurts, but more than you imagine
I've done more things for you than I've done for myself

Come with me, come with me, come
I know that my way, I'm your destiny that
If you don't stay, we won't solve
The wanting and the rejection, win and losе

I fly and I dream, with my hands I created a kingdom
Whеre I dream and I come back despite the weight
I'm waiting for you, but
There's no need for good and bad
In the story that we want

Woah-oh-oh-oh, uoh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh, uoh-oh

I don't know what I would do without me, my dear, if one day I turn off
Neither I would know what I would do without you since you're my light
Can't know what I am, but for you I've always been the bad guy
Luck doesn't come with my dices
Give me another mistake and we go

Come with me, come with me, come
I know that my way, I'm your destiny that
If you don't stay, we won't solve
The wanting and the rejection, win and lose

I fly and I dream, with my hands I created a kingdom
Where I dream and I come back despite the weight
I'm waiting for you, but
There's no need for good and bad
In the story that we want
I fly and I dream, with my hands I created a kingdom
Where I dream and I come back despite the weight
I'm waiting for you, but
There's no need for good and bad
In the story that we want

Woah-oh-oh-oh, uoh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh, uoh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh, uoh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh, uoh-oh
