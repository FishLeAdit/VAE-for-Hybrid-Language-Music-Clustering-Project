You're getting very old you know
I think it's rather nice you should be more interested in having a good time than finding a rich husband
Stretching out across the dancing floor
Hips and sways are calling for more
He jumps right in
Hoping to score
That's why  looking at her
Oh oh ah
Oh oh ooh
Oh oh ah
Do you wanna follow her tail?

Drinking up your cocktail
Swinging in the coconut milk
The breeze is warm
It's caught in your hair
You know your skin feel like silk
Oh oh ah
Oh oh ooh
Oh oh ah
Do you wanna follow her tail?

Dancing with the cocktail lady
Dancing with the cocktail lady
 cock

Cocktail lady ah
Cocktail lady ooh
Cocktail lady ow!
Do you wanna follow her tail?
