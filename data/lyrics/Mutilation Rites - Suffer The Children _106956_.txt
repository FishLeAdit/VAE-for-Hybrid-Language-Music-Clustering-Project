Figures cast shadows on a stairwell
What kind of life would we live without the sort of abuse
Sometimes you can only cope with so much
A smell, a sound, scars on the arm
A guilty look, lies, and failure
Nothing can compete with the penultimate truth
We are always filth
It can be an attractive escape
Hot blades of anguish
A wish for peace
