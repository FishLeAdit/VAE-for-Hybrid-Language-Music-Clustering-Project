It's strange that I can feel nothing
Strange, but you're afraid of me
So, just stomp around the true and true
But I've no proper boots
But we'll protect you from the story
You will die for all the time I spent
With you since we first met
But I'm no longer here for you
No longer here for you
La la lala lalala
La lalalala la lalalala
La lalala la lalala
La la lalala
La la lala lalala
La lalalala lalalala
La lalala la lalala
La la lalala
How come you're still within me?
I had it right before
How come they're still within me?
The blood just refuse to show
Well man, it just refuses
It's just refused to show
It's just refused to show
La la lala lalala
La lalalala la lalalala
La lalala la lalala
La la lalala
La la lala lalala
La lalalala la lalalala
La lalala la lalala
La la lalala
