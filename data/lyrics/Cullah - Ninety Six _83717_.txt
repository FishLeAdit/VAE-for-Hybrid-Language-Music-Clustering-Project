When I die put me in a mausole—
Wearing Demna Gvasalia
'Til the death need my per diem, I should reup
All these headshots, and hollow tips, ain't hard to reach 'em
Send this money to the shell account in Argentina
Part of me should try to feel the way I felt when I was no one
Instead of making plays, gotta stay to watch my nephew grow up
Hard to know what's real anymore when I'm looking at thе ceiling of the bunk
Hard to show up when my feelings validatеd by your love
Like it ain't hard enough to wake up every morning as it is
And that's how it's been, I feel it's twice as bad for y'all
(Too many diamonds make the watch heavy)
It's a wrist breaker, I'm a bitch taker
Get paper, switch fits, you mistake 'em, this rate, I been ballin'
You been fake, you been fraudin'
I'm over that, 'cause you back on that bullshit
And I'm back on my shit, bull
It's wishful thinking that you'd have a dog in this fight
You should wish more 'cause I'm Vick, bull
And I stand that ground, dog
The one that you went and ran back on
You the type we should go and pull masks on
And ask, "What the fuck did you ever came back for?"
As soon as you thought you were getting as good as my last song
Had to go and prove that wrong
Get smacked and laughed at where I'm from
They'd tell you that's a bad jawn
And I ain't worried 'bout a dollar, or whether I get my next spin
T-t-this is not a fight club, we jumping you if you step in
So tell a bitch ass motherfucker it's destined
I been all around the world and back
So what the fuck do y'all know when you ain't stepped out your backyard?
I know none of y'all are thurl as that
So stop talking down on me, actin' tough when you tryna act hard
They told me put my old shit back up, I gave them tracks up
A made a million off this, y'all lucky I never act up
I keep my boys fed, and my family's racks up
Oh, no, oh, no, and on the—
And on the low, when I exchange, I'm iffy about the hand
Balenciaga pants, with or without 'em, I'm still the man
It's different, do what I want, you bitchin', do what you can
I keep it the way it's been, you switch up and ditch the fam

Oh God, on God, on God, why do they act up?
A long time coming, and a longer time has us dead
Get me to the start of the ending
It's way too late to stay as much as it's tempting me
It's tempting me, it's tempting me

I watch myself look back at all the things that I've done
The person I have become in the last few years
And I wouldn't change it for the world
Why the fuck would I change it for you?

Why would I change it for you?
Why would I change it for you?
Do you know who the fuck you are?
'Cause I know who the fuck I am
And I will never change it for you (Yeah)

I remember back, 2016, a '97 Ford, 250,000 miles on it seems forever ago
Was making fifteen songs a week in the basement, just me and Drew
I wish we could've seen the future on a split screen
Was slept on back then
Now mo'fuckers wishing that they would wake up in this dream
'Cause we ain't shopping at the mall no more
We fuck around and spend a thousand on Rick jeans
Ten bands on a wrist piece
Advancing to give these mo'fuckers a taste of the medicine that they'd give me
Lil' bitch, please, either get with it or let my clique breathe
This is not the same energy that I would expect if you made up to the big leagues
I been me after everything that I've been seen
I wouldn't trust a soul, keep my head up whenever it gets mean
Ain't signed on no 360, we split it up over on this team
Target up over their head
Never missing a moment to make sure this shit bleeds
And they still sleeping on me
