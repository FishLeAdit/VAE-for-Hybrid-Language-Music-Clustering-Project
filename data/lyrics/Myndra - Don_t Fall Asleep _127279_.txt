It's not the taste of the kiss that pulls us in
It's the promise of getting that close again
I can't take away the feeling in your stomach
The part of you that's missing
You don't love this anymore

Everything is changing
The memories are fading
The world was open doors
And now they're shutting in our faces

But I want you to see tomorrow
'Cause it's more beautiful than you can see today
And I want you to feel no sorrow
Maybe we can learn to dream while we're awake
Don't fall asleep, Carolina
Hold on to me
And we can learn to live again

Sometimes we run beside the marathon runners
Too afraid of lagging behind
I can tell you that God only makes treasures
Of all the mistakes in this world
You're the one I wanna remember

Everything is changing
The memories are fading
The silhouette kisses and ten cent wishes
Are burning out tonight

But I want you to see tomorrow
'Cause it's more beautiful than you can see today
And I want you to feel no sorrow
Maybe we can learn to dream while we're awake
Don't fall asleep, Carolina
Hold on to me
I know you're dying for a sunset
Don't fall asleep
Oh, Carolina
Hold on to me
And we can learn to live again

I want you to see tomorrow
'Cause it's more beautiful than you can see today
And I want you to feel no sorrow
Maybe we can learn to dream while we're awake
Don't fall asleep
