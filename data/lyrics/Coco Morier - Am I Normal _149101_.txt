Am I normal
Sharing my heart with you
When you’re so cold to me
I’m hanging like a puppet
Would you put the string down?
No one, I'm not to do, no
I’ve falling for you
And you’ve been acting so strange
Can’t make you behave
Am I normal
Am I normal

It’s so hard to figure out what planet you are on
Venus and Mars have a connection
If you're normal and I’m not well that makes me a freak
Babe crock my heart cause your talk is cheap

I don’t know what I was thinking
Close my eyes, why I’m not dreaming

Am I normal
Sharing my heart with you
When you’re so cold to me
I’m hanging like a puppet
Would you put the string down?
No one, I'm not to do, no
I’ve falling for you
And you’ve been acting so strange
Can’t make you behave
Am I normal
Am I normal

You act so pristine but your clean gloves hide dirty hands
Begging for more than a second chance
I tried everything I could, I wanted it to last
But you wanted a barbie doll romance

Am I normal
Sharing my heart with you
When you’re so cold to me
I’m hanging like a puppet
Would you put the string down?
No one, I'm not to do, no
I’ve falling for you
And you’ve been acting so strange
Can’t make you behave

Am I normal
Sharing my heart with you
When you’re so cold to me
I’m hanging like a puppet
Would you put the string down?
No one, I'm not to do, no
I’ve falling for you
And you’ve been acting so strange
Can’t make you behave
Am I normal
Am I normal
