I just grow up as you do
You'll never blow me down
I just burn out as you do
You better watch your tongue
How dare you say that I was born to die?
Standing on the road we are kings of time
We are kings of life, yeah
It's exactly what I need
We are all such products, honey
You say I deserve it
I feel like a horse of a different color
Mother, mother, do we know each other?
I have nothing to say
Mother, mother, do we need each other?
I have nothing to say
