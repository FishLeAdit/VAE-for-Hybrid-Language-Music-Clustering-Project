Rwgardless of where you're from
You know, it's where you're at
You know like if, if people can't
If people, you know, use a crutch
As far as, you know, they ain't got this, or they ain't got that
You know that's, everything else is material
You know what I'm saying?
As long as they've got their physical form and their mind
Whatever they want to happen can happen

(Test, yeah...)
I changed myself for acceptance but I ain't even regrettin'
The things I've done in my past cause everything is a lesson
God even sent me a message, he said it's time for a change
We idolizing the people who got us staying the same
Gotta make a dent in the game, gotta make a change for the greater
Gotta get your mind on the paper, stay on your grind like a skater
Just worry about what's important, stay focused and keep ignoring
The one's who're slowing your grind up to the speed of a tortoise
Gotta aim to be a Ford Taurus and travel countries like tourists
I promised momma and poppa that I would pay of their mortgage
Just in a couple of years, let's have a couple of beers
Throw your glass in the air everybody let's have a cheers
And know that life will get better, I'm flowin' cold wear a sweater
I do this shit for the love, it's just a plus making cheddar
On tracks I snap like a center, that shouldn't be a surprise
Determination and hunger are sitting right in my eyes

And I've been working hard for so long
So tell me what it is you want from me
Cause even when I give it my all
It's never enough, no it's never enough
First they love you, all so proud of you
When you're in trouble, that's when they judge you
I guess it's never enough, no it's never enough
It's never enough from me

(Ayo... Kinetics in your headphones)
Yo, life is a headache, every day is a hassle
I stay raddled, taking Advil and breaking the capsule
Now my brain is so fried, this November I'mma go to the polls high
Go inside, and just vote for the old guy
At nineteen my song got me a plaque
That had my whole life stopped in its tracks, chopped it in half
And everything's so unreal now
Eminem is rapping on my song and I'm signing pub deals, how?
I feel like I'm Mr. Mathers right after the Rap Olympics
After throwing demos at Aftermath and having them have a listen
But since then there's been an infinite percent
Trying to prove to all the non-believers I'll do it again
And even my own mother is one of them when I hug her
Wondering if I'm a one-hit-wonder, no wonder
The pressure to be impressive is pressin'
So we press on and get prescribed medicine for depression
Yo, most of our lives we're just told to abide
By the road chosen we take emotion and hold it inside
So don't be surprised if little Joe goes to the bridge
Climbs over the side, closes his eyes and hopes that he flies

And I've been working hard for so long
So tell me what it is you want from me
Cause even when I give it my all
It's never enough, no it's never enough
First they love you, all so proud of you
When you're in trouble, that's when they judge you
I guess it's never enough, it's never enough
No it's never enough from me

(Y'all don't, Ya'll don't)
Know what it's like to have your first love move away
And every single day, you struggling through the pain
Can't even turn to Mary Jane, cause I'm mentally addicted
Both my doctor and psychiatrist told me I need to kick it
So I did, my grandpa's dying, can't even get up out his chair
Just got diagnosed with cancer and now he's losing his hair
I constantly live with fear, man I really need to hear
Some good news cause I feel like I ain't smiled in a year
I'm crying tears during the day, anxiety eats away
My emotions and my feelings, I really can't catch a break
When my grandpa pass away, my granny won't be the same
She gon' start to blame herself but there ain't nobody to blame
But society, depression lives inside of me
Wish it would say goodbye to me, it's messing with my brain like a lobotomy
But even that ain't stopping me from giving my all
Cause even through the darkest times when my back is against the wall, I'll never fall

And I've been working hard for so long
So tell me what it is you want from me
Cause even when I give it my all
It's never enough, no it's never enough
First they love you, all so proud of you
When you're in trouble, that's when they judge you
I guess it's never enough, it's never enough
No it's never enough from me
