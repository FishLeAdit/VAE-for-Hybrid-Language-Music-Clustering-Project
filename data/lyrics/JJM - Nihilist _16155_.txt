Closed mouths don't get fed from me
You already know what you're in for
Mixing drugs with insanity
Smoke flow beneath the locked door
Inhale, smoke following
My chest is hallow again
I found peace beneath the underworld
Inhale, smoke following
My chest is hallow again
I found peace beneath the underworld

So we'll find a way
So we'll find a way
So we'll find a way
So we'll find a way

You can take off the rings I gave to you
They look better on another whore
You ate the keys, you left these chains on me
Put me out of my misery

My name ring bells
Now I'm on fire, giving all these bitches hell
Why you didn't say how you felt when I knew you wouldn't care
I was tryna help
We were almost there
We were almost there
Living in the world, feel the restless dream
So I stay up late 'cause it's stressing me
And you know that I'm high as my tolerance
And I swear that this bottle is bottomless
Lil' shawty, what's the deal?
I'm just tryna spend a couple mill
Floor the foreign, it's probably worth a fortune
But I know you wouldn't care

So we'll find a way
So we'll find a way
So we'll find a way
So we'll find a way

You can take off the rings I gave to you
They look better on another whore
You ate the keys, you left these chains on me
Put me out of my misery, yeah

Put me out of my misery, yeah
Put me out of my misery, yeah
