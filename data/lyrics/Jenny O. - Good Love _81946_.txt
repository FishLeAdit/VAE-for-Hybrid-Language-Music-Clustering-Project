I am not here to make a change in you
I'm not here to make a home
And you are afraid to break my heart in two
But you won't
You don't love me, baby, and you never will
It's not a question still
But hey hey here's the money
Hey hey here's a song
Now where's the good love, honey?
You got me all wrong
So stop talking, you don't make sense
Don't say you're sorry solely in your own defense
If you can't understand it, don't believe it's true
But keep your head on right, I need the rest of you
'Cause I don't love you, baby, I'm just passing through
Till I get my hands on you
Hey hey here's the money
Hey hey here's a song
Now where's the good love, honey?
You got me all wrong
If you don't see me crying
Don't rescue me
If you don't see me trying
I am occupied and free
You don't love me, baby, you're no good for me
It's not a mystery
Hey hey here's the money
Hey hey here's a song
Now where's the good love, honey?
You got me all wrong
I don't love you, baby, I'm just passing through
Till I get my hands on you
Hey hey here's the money
Hey hey here's a song
Now where's the good love, honey?
You got me all wrong
