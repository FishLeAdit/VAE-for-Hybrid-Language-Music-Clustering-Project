Deep in another dream
Thinking about you
Sailing through the city streets
Thinking about you
It's only been a little while
But I'm thinking about you
Can't hide another smile

I've been thinking about you

But I never look back (Never look back)
Never look over my shoulder
And I never react (Never react)
Can't go where I've gone before
No, I never look back (Never look back)
Now I've grown so much colder
And you're fading to black (Fading to black)
Like it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all

Deep in another dream
Thinking about you
Feels like the final scene
Thinking about you
Save it for a little while
Thinking about you
Time for another smile

I've been thinking about you

But I never look back (Never look back)
Never look over my shoulder
And I never react (Never react)
Can't go where I've gone before
No, I never look back (Never look back)
Now I've grown so much colder
And you're fading to black (Fading to black)
Like it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all


But I never look back (Never look back)
Never look over my shoulder
And I never react (Never react)
Can't go where I've gone before
No, I never look back (Never look back)
Now I've grown so much colder
And you're fading to black (Fading to black)
Like it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all (Thinking about you)
It's nothing at all
It's nothing at all(Thinking about you)
Thinking about you
