Look at this
It don't fit
You've put wild into it
I'm amazed
You've put wild into it
What can I give you
What can I give
Cool place
I'm amazed
You rock me into space
You put cake
Down my throat
And in my face
What can I give you
What can I take
Kissing you's like kissing gravel
But feel's like getting off
Kissing you's like sinking
Down into the moss
You look better upside down
You look better lying down
On the move
I can lose
All my sympathy for you
Sitting straight
On the back of mother hate
What can I tell you
What can I say
On my knees
I can see
All your better qualities
So you freeze
I make frozen into heat
What can I tell you
That you'll believe
Kissing you's like kissing gravel
But feels like getting drunk
Kissing you's like sinking
Down into the mud
You look better upside down
You look better lying down
For today
I've arranged
To be just enough deranged
To relax
In the arms of someone strange
I promise you today
I promise you today
I promise you today
