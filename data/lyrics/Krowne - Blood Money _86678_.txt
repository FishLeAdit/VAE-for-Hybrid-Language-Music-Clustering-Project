Most notorious gang up west
Most glorious bitch chains a flex
Coast to coast boy I'll take the west
Hop on a boat post-robbery
We'll have to head down the East Coast
Off the boat, then we robbed the coach
Spent that money, yeah, cash cash
On a brand new coat, you don't want the smoke
Blood Money, Blood Money
Hungry for the Blood Money
The Blood Money
The Blood Money
Blood Money
Smokes & cigars like our name is Dutch & Arthur
And the whole gang with me
Hosea's old, look like he be turning 60
But bitch we go, down the old rodeo
Like it's 1950, but it's 1899
Yeah, new millennium starts
They don't know what the car is
Yeah this is prehistoric
Like in comparison to the GTA 6
That came out album-wise before it
We the highest scoring
Euphoric times
When we get high off the smokes & cigars & reefer
Blood Money
