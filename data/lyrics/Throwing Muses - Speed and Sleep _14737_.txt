Was a man took a hand, cleared the ground
Dug a hole we called home
Sprawled here
Eleven years, forty-four seasons
We came unstuck and it stung
Unstuck-ness flew me
Though the air whispered in my ear
This is chaos and it stings
Tiny strings across the United States
Run from you to me and to everyone we ever breathed with
I don't care if you're sad
I don't care if your heart is breaking
You soothe me and you turn me on
Speed and sleep
I lock the dogs in the car
And cut across the parking
I'm far away today
But I might as well not be
You quit making mistakes
I might not leave
You quit making mistakes
I might just stay
