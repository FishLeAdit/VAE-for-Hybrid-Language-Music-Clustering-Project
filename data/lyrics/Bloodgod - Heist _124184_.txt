Blood and death fill my eyes
As I track the ones responsible
For my land's demise
Now see them up ahead
Sheltering in a place of dread
It's called Bloodmound Mine
The place all slaves go to die
The place where I now must go
To let my axe sow
I sprint to the mine
Axe in hand looking
To commit my justified crime
There all sitting there
Drinking their beer
The slaves watch as I
Approach those who
Burned my town to the ground
No slavе makes a sound
The man-at-arms are
Too sot to noticе me
There just sitting there
Each without a care
Revelling in the time
That they've shared
Now they die!
I raise my axe overhead
Hear the screams of those
Who are already dead
Those I couldn't protect
Won't leave my head
Their blood's on me
Just as much
As on them!
I swing my axe in one deft blow
Splitting one of my foes
I watch as his life blood
Seeps into the earth
This is Bloodmound Mine
The place these king's men die
The place where I now must fight
To let my axe sow
Now I go axe in hand
As I swing another blow
I watch them fall
Now they're on the ground
These dead don't make a sound
Their blood flows at my feet!
Here comes more
As I wade through the gore
Their blood is already
Calling to me
This time they will
Feel the pain that
Now fuels me
Now they die!
I raise my axe overhead
Hear the screams of those
Who are already dead
Those I couldn't protect
Won't leave my head
Their blood's on me
Just as much
As on them!
I swing my axe blade back and forth
Watch as their blood spills
I swing my axe blade back and forth
Now see their entrails
I watch them die!
I cut them down one by one
This blood bath has just begun
My axe whirls under the setting sun
Their pained screamed
Will be heard by none
Their blood will spurt
And life become dirt
So now they try to run
But they will never ever escape me!
Now all the king's men are dead
Their blood and bodies surround me
I look around and see
All the slaves trying
To break free
Eyes full of fear as they
Desperately try to flee, they fear me!
I raise my axe overhead
Hear the screams of those
Who are not yet dead
Those I may still protect
Now fill my head
Their life's on me
Just as much
As mine's on theirs!
I bring my axe down
Their chains burst
Now my new people
Gather around!
