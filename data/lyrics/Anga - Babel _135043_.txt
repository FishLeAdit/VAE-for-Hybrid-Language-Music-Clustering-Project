The anger’s lying in my yall
Society just gave me scars
Coldest villain breaking laws
Fuck you over clean and raw
Hellfire like Dr. Shaw
Magnets you’re attracting all
Cardi B’s and Remy Mas
Wolf on street’s and howling walls (Pimp shit!)
Blaxploitation with no oasis I’m in Danger
So I’m forced to slapping suckers like I’m dolomite
Indulge the plight, tell me who can overcome this kryptonite?
I’m Brad Pitt to the rappers go to clubs and start a fucking fight
Fuck milly rocking on every block, I'm chopping like Go-Go never stopped
Subtract the weak police draws the chalk
Hands down like six thirty on clocks
No evidence, murder scene a street across from presidents
Be hesitant, and know your life can end by any second bitch!

You know you can’t survive you’re stuck inside a zoo
A slave within your mind I know you got no clue
You know you won’t survive, I know you won’t survive
Don’t try to change the tides, you’re stuck inside a zoo

It’s like I’m speaking tongues to a bunch of cowards
I’ve been placed in a state that’s here to devour my soul
My heart, my innocents, my sanity

Ima channel this one and I will not succumb
I believe in no lucketts I’m trying to make ruckus
Like you giving birth to the cheaper by dozen
Don’t pull my strings like I’m dancing puppets
I trust nobody cause I’m so reluctant
Everyday life is a damn struggle
I battle with myself like stunt doubles
I’m too complex, fucked up puzzles
So frustrated I’m about to crumble
And ready to blow like I burst my bubbles
Rappers trying to stunt like they flexing muscles
I’m on the brink I’m this close to trouble
It’s all on me to sack you to fumble
Truth be told I got nothing to miss
I can’t be stuck in a bucket with a bunch of cancers
Robbing hood and steal from the rich
I’m taking what I need like shitty manner
Like run it, run it hands up
Play the victim but you better not sue
Slumming slumming hands up
If you want half a mil like me too?
My father told me "man up"
Momma told me "plan up"
Contraception never had a Plan B
Always screamed fuck you, fuck him
Fuck her, fuck everybody
Fuck granny and your momma too (Mira!)
Look into my eyes, don’t you see the fire
That ignites me fool? (Mira!)
Know you can’t survive in the lion's den
This is babel in a zoo
Child of an immigrant, I’m in this shit
Till you decapitate my head so quick

Tell me how you feel about me..
