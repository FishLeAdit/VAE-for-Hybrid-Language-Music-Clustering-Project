Desire took a seat at my side
And softly said to me
"I know you want to go your own way
But you're too weak to be free."
I said to it, "I know you mean well
But this time you are wrong
I've thought this through, I promise you, I've got to move on
And I don't want you along."
Here I stand with a bird in hand and here I will remain
I would rather let it stay than to watch a hundred fly away
You'll be fine in a little time when I am out of view
I'm not trying to say goodbye, I know I'll see you soon
