And where, where, where is my gypsy wife tonight?
I've heard all the wild reports, they can't be right
But whose head is this she's dancing with on the threshing floor?
Whose darkness deepens in her arms just a little more?

And where, where is my gypsy wife tonight?
Where, where is my gypsy wife tonight?

Ah, the silver knives are flashing in that tired old cafe
A ghost climbs on a table wearing a bridal nеgligee
She says, "My body is the light," she says, "My body is thе way"
I raise my arm against it all and I catch the bride's bouquet

And where, where is my gypsy wife tonight?
Where, where is my gypsy wife tonight?


It's too early for the rainbow, it's too early for the dove
These are the final days, this is the darkness, this is the flood
But there is no man or woman who can be touched
But you who come between them, you will surely be judged

And where, where is my gypsy wife tonight?
Where, where is my gypsy wife tonight?
Where, where is my gypsy wife tonight?
Where, where is my gypsy wife tonight?
