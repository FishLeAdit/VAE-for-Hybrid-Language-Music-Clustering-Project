My dreams have become its dreams!
It calls to me!
It begs for me to unearth it from its cradle of black soil!
Screaming to be released!

It promises knowledge and power
To turn men to dust, and gods into cowards
Voice like an echo, distant, and hollow
Relentless, vicious, it beckons I follow
I'm lost in my world, thoughts of my own
There's no hiding 'cause it's inside me
And just to remind me, it screams in my mind
Until my eyes bleed!

You won't find its power if you seek it
It's sanctuary secret and it'll cement
Your entry to Hell if you recite the text
Decipher this instruction to take lives from the next
Manifest itself and takes ahold
Blowing my sanity, blowing my soul
Its backwards words give birth to behemoths
Necromantic schemes pave way to the zenith

Read the pages inside the tome of the black tongue
(Penned in blood and)
Rehearse the verses and learn the curses of the black tongue
(For many moons I have searched)
With every passage more is revealed
Converging the non believers to kill

(Penned in blood and)

For many moons I have searched
Slowly descending into madness
Penned in blood and bile
Lie the secrets from an all but forgotten rite

Every word that you murmur is dangerous
Bleeding lacerations ink the pages with the paper cuts
If it's in your radius you fantasize murder
Paralyzed in a trance it's a page turner
Infernal word from the Old God passed down
Read aloud black clouds demons up in the background
Rome splinters above, vast desert like sands
The fall of man if it falls in the wrong hands

Sacrificial, speaking of this
Many died seeking to see a peek or a glimpse
Of the pages that are ageless and stained with the blood of the ancient
It lays tainted in the place it was created
Suffer through stages of suffocation
Levitating, repeating phrases that summon Satan
No sign of change everything's heinous
So sign your name and sing praises when you

Its cross of evil guided me
It was hidden in the depths of a desolate church
Finally a chance to acquire the knowledge within

Trying to fight the urge to recite the words
Tome of the Black Tongue, hidden within's a curse
It was written in a church waiting for you to find it
(Many moons I have searched)
Its image burned in your mind, you're reminded
Exactly what this means the text is commanding heed
Threw away hope, accepted insanity
Beckon to a tome that might not even exist
Still stuck searching for the secrets of the abyss

I know I'm close to the place I have to find
I can hear its heart beating in the back of my mind
I'm doomed, consumed by its curse
I stand outside the ruins of what used to be a church
The voice seems different, desperate, more frantic
Screaming for me to release it, it commands it
It's too loud now, it's driving me insane
A gold glow hurts my eyes but I can't look away, I gotta

Wretched whisperings increase in volume and clarity
As I approach the ruins of this accursed place
The book's terrible and dreadful power
Growing stronger with each step
Approaching it, I can feel its 
As soon as my hands touched its fleshy binds
All sounds stopped
The tome is finally mine
