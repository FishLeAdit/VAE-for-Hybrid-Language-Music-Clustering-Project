Cvees (ft. Probe DMS, Ike P, and Swave Sevah) - “Dro Please”

Roll that dro, please
And lick.  Come on, son, roll that up
And twist.  Come on, son, roll that up
That spliff.  Come on, son, roll that up

Well, it was
One of them nights around five to ten
I blew my last L trying to get high again
So I called up my good old supplier friend
He went as low as a ten for dro, yo
Two could roll a L as thin as a pig pen
But if I spend twenty, that’ll be half of my money
Man, fuck it.  I’ma call up my dunny and
See if he got half in the stash for the gummies

Well, I’m in the crib, busting the grub, eating the funnies
The phone rings.  “Probe, what’s cracking?”  “Ain’t shit.  What up?”
“We need to meet up and go half on this spliff”
“That’s cool, but, first, I got to ditch this straggling bitch
‘Cause, once she smell it, she wants to inhale it, always like
'What’s popping?' but never come out of her pockets to get it"
“Ayyo, y’all trying to get the smoke, yo?” “Stop running
Your mouth and hang up my phone.  This ain’t your house”
She like:

And twist.  Come on, son, roll that up
That spliff.  Come on, son, roll that up

Haha, Swave, we bounced without the spouses
I know this house party that’s down a couple of houses
They got the Bacardi.  I copped a couple of ounces
We ‘bout to bent on a couch like some slouches

Word?  Well, I got something to add.  May not be
As much as a ounce but it’s a nice-sized bag
And it’s the highest strain that you could put in your body
It’s serious—I’ll let you smell it when we get in the lobby
Whoa!  There’s a lot of hoes at this party
Oh!  Look at her.  I know she’s a hottie
Yo, pass me the Dutch, let me twist these trees.  Ayyo
Probe, I think shorty’s licking her lips at me

Woah, I think
So.  Shorty grinding like she toe-back
That’s when I pulled out something to roll like, “Hold that”
That’s when she strolled over, sat on me, gave me a lap dance
With romance in her voice, looking Janet-mold, she said:

Roll that dro, please
And lick.  Come on, son, roll that up
And twist.  Come on, son, roll that up
That spliff.  Come on, son, roll that up

Damn it, yo
I’m coming up short.  Yo, I got to get my cheese up
Let me go outside and just strip you this re-up
I just finished stuffing these bags.  Y’all better grab
A couple dimes and dubs and post up on the ave
In spite of my nigga Ike, about to "Walk On" fast
“Ayyo, Ike, what’s good, dawg?”  “I’ll stay in the hood, god
You’re just the person that I needed to see.  Give
Me three.”  “Yo, keep your money, god.  This one’s on me.”  “Yo, look, yo
Who this bitch that walking up with the cheese?”  “Yo, that’s that bitch
Shantise.  She always trying to burn the next man’s trees.”  “I seen you
Smoking, Sevah.” “We’re busy.  You might as well continue
Your route ‘cause there’s no way the blunt is touching your mouth”
“Yo, keep it moving, Shanty.  Just walk that path straight
Don’t be pulling that shit—it’s new-old and half-baked.”  Then right
Before she decided to skate, she licked her lips
With the thirst in her face.  She was dying to say, “Can we...”
