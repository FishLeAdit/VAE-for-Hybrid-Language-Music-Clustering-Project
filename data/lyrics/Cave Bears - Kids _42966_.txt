It's not supposed to be safe
I don't know why you're crying
It's not supposed to be perfect
I don't know why you're crying

First daughter's my mama
Second daughter's grandmama
First son is your father
Second son, your grandfather (Crying)
First time is my mama
Second daughter's grandmama (Crying)
First time is your father
Second son's your grandfather (Crying)

And they came back
And they, and they came back
They all come back
Somebody asked me, "Do we turn to birds when we die?"
I replied, "Do angels have wings?"
And they came back
And they came back (Oh, woah, ooh)
(And they came back)
(Oh, woah)
(Oh, woah)
(Oh, woah)


Oh, woah
Oh, woah
