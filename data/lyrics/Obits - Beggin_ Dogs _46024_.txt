Dead onsite in the USA
I'm a slave in all but name
Where am I getting off
Can't stop a train yeah what's got a roll on

What's between us
What's in that haze
It's war between us
That's what I say
Fight hard to find
Common cause
Fight hard for the common good
Of beggin' dogs
Beggin' dogs
Ain't out to trade in any arms
Ain't out to do nobody no harm
No good til' you're sick and hurt
Ain't bred for nothing but work

What's between us
What's in that haze
It's war between us
That's what I say
Fight hard to find
Common cause
Fight hard for the common good
Of beggin' dogs
Soon enough babe
You'll be beggin' too

Fight hard to find
Common cause
Fight hard for the common good
Of beggin' dogs
Fight hard to find
Common cause
Fight hard for the common good
Of beggin' dogs
Beggin' dogs
Beggin' dogs
Of beggin' dogs
Yeah
