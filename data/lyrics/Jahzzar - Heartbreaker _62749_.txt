3 am you taking off your makeup
You start an argument and now you fed up
You leaving out the door like it's a break up
Told myself now it's time to move on
New chick tryna come in fast
New chick better then my damn last
New chick looking way to damn fine
New chick looking like she damn mine

She hit me with a heartbreak
She left me with this damn pain
She hit me with a heartbreak
She left me with this damn pain
