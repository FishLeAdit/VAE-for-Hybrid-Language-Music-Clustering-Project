Cindy writes a paragraph
Says time is passing
But the bubbles in her heart are everlasting
Yeah, she gave her life to art
And who could blame her?
It's pretty major
Fraught with dangerous
Stuff like that

Oh, mighty engine
Of good intention
You're purring softly beside me
Grinding gently inside me
Tapping totally madly
For you
For you

Says the plot is getting strange
Taken on new meaning
And the hero's run away
And no one stopped him
But she can't control the page
It's taking over
There's people dying, colons crying
And full stops finding fault
Oh, what a dot

Oh, mighty engine
Of good intention
You're purring softly beside me
Grinding gently inside me
Tapping totally madly
For you
For you
For you
For you

Cindy writes of kerosene
And broken bottles
Says the troubles were a part of someone's childhood
But she can't get past the point
Where someone's dying
It's pretty minor
A pithy liner should sort it out
But he won't die
He just mucks about
Oh, it's so hard

Now we've broken out the gin
It helps her thinking
And given in to sin
We're breathing deeply
But something's on her mind
A chapter's stirring
Her mind is whirling
And up she trots
To tap her keys to the top
Oh, she's off

Mighty engine
Of good intention
You're purring softly beside me
Grinding gently inside me
Tapping totally madly
For you
For you
For you
For you
