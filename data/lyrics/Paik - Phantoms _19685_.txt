I'm searching for a whole new beginning
An endless void
This notion that I sense within me
You're still by my side

Oh I feel your presence
You'll never leave here
But if I reach out there to hold you
Every part that's real disappears

As I become more present now
I can't see through the pain
A Hollow cut through my veins
(The phantom takes his toll)

The days, they just keep on coming
The stain that they will leave
I wish I could just break this casket
But i'm left here to grieve
In a world of my own design

As I become more present now
I can't see through the pain
A hollow cut through my veins
(The phantom takes his toll)
And did you leave me anything?
You're a phantom of my past
Do you expect me to last this way?

(A scar and a phantom pain)
