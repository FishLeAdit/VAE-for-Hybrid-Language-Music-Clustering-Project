It's time again to say goodbye
Cause you won't stay another night
I've seen you do this once before
You say you'll be here but then you leave
No one to help, set up the tree
It's time to go, I'll hold the door

It was time to get the tree
Don't know how long it will be
All that waiting was a bore
I thought that we were a match
But the start was just a scratch
Of the end, we can't ignore

Where'd you go after we kissed under the mistletoe
This winter has been overrated
Can we just skip this holiday
You flew away on Santa's sleigh
It's like last Christmas all again

Like a snowman my heart you melt
But I'll just take the cards you dealt
Cause you're not around anymore

Where'd you go after we kissed under the mistletoe
This winter has been overrated
Can we just skip this holiday
You flew away on Santa's sleigh
It's like last Christmas all again

You're gone now I am alone
It's like last Christmas all again
You're gone now I am alone
It's like last Christmas all again
You're gone now I am alone
It's like last Christmas all again
You're gone now I am alone
It's like last Christmas all again
