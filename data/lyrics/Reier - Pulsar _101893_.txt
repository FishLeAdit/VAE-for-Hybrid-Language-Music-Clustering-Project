And on my life I would bet
That from my hand to my neck
I could feel
Oh, you're taking a breath just to heal
When I strain just to open my mouth

Maybe if I try my best I can keep what I got
Maybe if I take it like a man I can be what I want

And on my life I would bet
That from my hand to my neck
Up from the leaves where I sit
You were repeating my lips
Your eyes return and convulse
You could feel my longing pulse
