Take our sorrows, take our tears
Heaven's not so far from here
Though we struggle, still we pray
There will be your better day

Show us mercy, give us rest
Hold the weary to your breast
For the child who lost his way
There will be your better day

Hallelujah, hallelujah
There will be your better day

A sweet forgiveness, shining light
Lift the darkness from our night
Help us find the strength to say
There will be your better day

Hallelujah, hallelujah
There will be your better day
Hallelujah, hallelujah
There will be a better day

Hallelujah, hallelujah
There will be your better day
