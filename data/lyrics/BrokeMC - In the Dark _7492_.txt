I will never go for as long as I live
I will always be

I've been your friend from the start
The one that listens to you
I know you don't think I'm there
I'm right there walking with you

I'll dissapear in the darkness, just waiting for you
I can't escape what i've done
So i'll just sit here in the shade and wait for the sun
I'll dissapear in the darkness just waiting for you
And until that day comes i'll watch over you
Hoping that you stay away from the

Me. I don't want to fall inside the shade
Looking in your eyes I feel the pain
Knowin nothin won't ever be the same
I can't see you when your in a dream
I don't want to fall inside the shade
Looking in your eyes I feel the pain
Knowin nothin won't ever be the same
I can't see you when your in a dream

I made you cry everynight
I see you standing above me
I'm stuck here on my own
'Coz you won't let me go

I'll dissapear in the darkness, just waiting for you
I can't escape what i've done
So i'll just sit here in the shade and wait for the sun
I'll dissapear in the darkness just waiting for you
And until that day comes i'll watch over you
Hoping that you stay away from the

Me. I don't want to fall inside the shade
Looking in your eyes I feel the pain
Knowin nothin won't ever be the same
I can't see you when your in a dream
I don't want to fall inside the shade
Looking in your eyes I feel the pain
Knowin nothin won't ever be the same
I can't see you when your in a dream

I wish I would have survived
So I'd still be by your side
I know you don't think I'm here
But Look down
I'm right here
I'm your shadow

I'll dissapear in the darkness, just waiting for you
I can't escape what i've done
So i'll just sit here in the shade and wait for the sun
I'll dissapear in the darkness just waiting for you
And until that day comes i'll watch over you
Hoping that you stay away from the

Me. I don't want to fall inside the shade
Looking in your eyes I feel the pain
Knowin nothin won't ever be the same
I can't see you when your in a dream
I don't want to fall inside the shade
Looking in your eyes I feel the pain
Knowin nothin won't ever be the same
I can't see you when your in a dream
I don't want to fall inside the shade
Looking in your eyes I feel the pain
Knowin nothin won't ever be the same
I can't see you when your in a dream
I don't want to fall inside the shade
Looking in your eyes I feel the pain
Knowin nothin won't ever be the same
I can't see you when your in a dream
