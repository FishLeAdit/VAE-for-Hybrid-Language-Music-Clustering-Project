Bullets sing through the skin of an unarmed black man
And swim to the heart of the north east side of town
And when they finally found their way, through decay, to the southside
They were caught in the teeth of rebellion, hate and need
But the need turned to greed and hate, it turned to anger
And the blue and the brown eyes turned to burning flames

London's still burning, and nothing's changed since the riots
People ignored the real sparks creating the fires
And I ain't praising the liars, out chasing desires
Instead of pursuing dreams, but I ain't blaming them either
'Cause nothing's the way it seems, they've been living crimes movies in private
Then decided go public and make a scene
'Cause they plug products like drugs everyday on our screens
Then judge, and turn their noses up when we change into friends
It's fucked, but imagine going to school and it's shit there
Don't want to go home for love 'cause it doesn't live there
You couldn't win there, so wouldn't think fair
On the road to insanity 'cause they're driven so quick there
And it's only mad men that wage these wars
Pushing killers to pulling triggers with crazy thoughts
You wanna protest but you ran up in JD Sports?
You burnt the wrong buildings down trying to change these laws
Just think

If they sold you coal would you take ashes
And taste tobacco smoked through pipes and peace
If the lonely souls of the old and ageing fascists
Changed and gave back those years of defeat on your streets
Yeah

Only mad men hold a gun
Only mad men hold a gun
Only mad men hold a gun
And only mad men hold a gun
Only mad men hold a knife
Only mad men hold a knife
Only mad men hold a knife
And only mad men hold a knife
Only mad men, only mad men
Only mad men, only mad men

Yo
It's hard being young, I was fifteen when i first saw a gun
Someone put one to my face, then my heart darkened with my lungs
Paranoia fathered a son, it was done, lost my faith in humanity
Working in a field filled with bad apple trees
Don't tit for tatter me with tales of your apathy
Will it be your judgement or my machete that's backing me?
This herd mentality is rife, we need to let go
The same way you panic buy for petrol
The same way some might stab a guy from some next road
But this ain't Hollywood, every corners got a Tesco
Shouting ride or die, letting the Tec blow
But when you die, was your life worth the debt? Hell knows
It's like there's two roads a young man can take
One with fear, one with hate
For real

If they sold you coal would you take ashes
And taste tobacco smoked through pipes and peace
If the lonely souls of the old and ageing fascists
Changed and gave back those years of defeat on your streets
Yeah

Only mad men hold a gun
Only mad men hold a gun
Only mad men hold a gun
And only mad men hold a gun
And only mad men hold a knife
Only mad men hold a knife
Only mad men hold a knife
And only mad men hold a knife
Only mad men, only mad men
Only mad men, only mad men

Only mad men pull the trigger
Only mad men feel bigger
Only mad men get done
And only mad men hold a gun
And only mad men push it in
Only mad men pierce the skin
Only mad men get life
And only mad men hold a knife
