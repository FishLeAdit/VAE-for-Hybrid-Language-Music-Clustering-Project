Outta my head it's glowing
Outta my head it's glowing
Outta my head things are different
Outta my head things are different

I just gotta get out of my head a bit
Out of the negative. Out of the pessimist
Posture of doubt where everything's relative
And everyone is my nemesis. -- --
Yeah. I just gotta get out of my bed again
Get back in the game though I might never win
The fight might never end, and nothing is forever
Every day is heaven sent, and everything is better
When I'm out of my head. The second I'm stepping out
Whenever I look at you, the second I left the house
The scent of the fresh air; the wind that carries us
The feeling we'll get there - {Outta my head}
That's when we deal with what's real
Can't numb the pain. To heal I must feel
The hurt for a season, but it hurts for a reason
Done dreaming, now I'm searching for meaning
Out of my head
Outta my head things are different
Outta my head things are different
Outta my head
Outta my
Outta my head

I just gotta get out of my head a bit
Out of the negative. Out of the pessimist
Posture of doubt where everything's relative
And everyone is my nemesis. -- --
Yeah. I just gotta get out of my bed again
Look out my window. See through a better lens
Look up to the sky. Look up to better men
The bretheren are getting together. I'm getting
Outta my head. -- Not everyone gets to live
Death is definite. The rest ain't guaranteed
Life is a gift we get to give. The world
Is desperate for us. I can't let it get
Outta my head. -- I can't see truth
But I can see proof the world's not lost
Whenever I see you, I believe in the magic
I believe that we have it. See that trip?
Poof. I'm outta my head
And I'm glad to be alive. Glad to see the sky
The sun, I see it rise. The love I keep inside
Is why I need to rhyme. I need to breathe a sigh
And let it out
Outta my head things are different
Outta my head
Outta my head
Outta my head
Outta my head
Outta my head things are different
Outta my head things are different
Outta my head
