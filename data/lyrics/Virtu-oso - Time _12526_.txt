"Guess who this is" - Kool G. Rap 'Thug Ones'
"Big Virt"
"Last of the real" - Kool G. Rap 'Thug Ones'

All my life I've talked like this
But I guess I'm just too honest
Cause it's
So hard to speak your mind
When half of the people clocking don't know how to keep the time

Yo
Bringing the kick smash stinging the sticks the Virtuoso
Your bird wants to step so beware like Coco
Oh no, he did it flip it the meticulous
Rhytmic precision of a metrinome mechanism
Is it him?
Why yes in the flesh it's
Miguel-ito can I speak so fresh
Two techniques
Hypodermic needles filled with antidote
Neccisary precautionary measures for my cancer quotes
Grammar smoke
Fiery that burns suns
Oxygen tank lung box cutter shank tongue
Roll over posers, soldiers in the bulldozer choke
Gods high rollers smoke lah from Angola
That's been dusted with Ebola
Strike frames like world champ bowlers
So fly they call me air traffic controller
The leader of a team of Tigers like Matt Nokes
I catch most and my bat strokes will slap folks
Don't discriminate between Muslims and Christians
I speak to those who listen, spittin' repetition
So it sticks in your mind like a thorn in your side
We been born and divide goin to war over pride
Now were gonna decide whether to hold a grudge
Put the gun to the side it's better to show some love
And roll some bud and get high as a kite
If God take me now it's aite, I wanna die on the mic
It's like


The most integral parts of our community are usually number two or three
On our list of priorites
Who's the minority who's majority
And what senority accepts somebody sayin' "More for me"
In this american dream it becomes more apparent the scheme
Is that the rich will inherit the cream
We need to integrate, interracially interface
Cross inseminate summer and winter makes a splinter hate
I'm into safe livin
And if it means giving up people thinking I'm hard
Well that's okay I hate prison
In rap the best there is
I ain't never heard a cat that spit
A verse half as fresh as this so give me your cash and Lexus's

"Guess who this is"
"Big Virt"
"My strikes are fatale" - Virtuoso 'Exertions (Remix)'
"Guess who this is"
"Big Virt"
Last of the real"


The Archbishop pass me the branch spark this bitch up
Hit them dark sisters with rhythm their heart switch up
To match the pitch up so get up outta your seat
My fat grammar, jackhammer powder the streets
It's Virtuoso
The most cunning linguist
I practice my raps while I'm performing cunnulingus
Rappers say they let more shells fly than beetles
Then in the same verse complain about they dying people
Now son you ain't got nothing to prove
And they just bucking at you cause they got nothing to lose
The true lesson, we need to stop stressin
Who's the hardest, walk away see another day stay modest
Lay with ya godess, get weeded up and seated up
Time for creation no more destruction I've seen enough
Virtuoso's on a global change mission
To get the opressed switched to the best social positions
We puff a double dutch, pass and skip past ya'll like double dutch
Chill and let the deep thoughts bubble up
