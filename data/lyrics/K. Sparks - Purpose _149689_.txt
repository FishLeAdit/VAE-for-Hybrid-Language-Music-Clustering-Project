Verse
I feel with this pen that I’m dangerous
I don’t do well round new strangers
Feel that I’m making y’all anxious
Feel like a King don’t got patience
Feel like Im taking respect feel like I’m banking a check Don’t this feel like a blade to the neck I just gain the respect All the pain I inject in the lain I connect
Run around town like a villain
Switch flows every time that the wind blows
Got me feeling like a tempo in the end though Everybody asking how you been though
Hold up hold up yeah I’m fine
Body in the body bag yeah thats mine
I just diе to myself and I cry to myself and I lie to mysеlf All these thoughts on the shelf
Got purpose Got purpose
Ain’t nobody gonna stop my purpose
Got purpose Got purpose
Ain’t nobody gonna stop my purpose
Thoughts in my mind as I fought to define
What I’m taught to define as success no
Reach for the nine and I’m blowing they mind
Got me taking whats mine I confess
