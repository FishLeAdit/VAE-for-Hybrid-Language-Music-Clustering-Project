Reality is a thing and matrix is a possibility
And we almist find ourselves and senses
And looking all around to find our penses
And find our penches
Being paid minimum wage
Is a failure in our lives
Need to eat some chips and be lazy
Fat people on earth, earth is a failure out of all the universe and we need to find it quick and quick and quick and now

Gaming is our life and gaming is a way everything has to do it with electronics in our modern day
Pollution sucks ass and it’s pretty gay (yay)
History is dead, because of our own plague
When people get bored, thеy just started Jade When a hookеr leave my house, I’ve just been played
The society sucks today because of what we made
What the hell is the bridge gonna say?
Oh wait

You already heard it but the society sucks
If you were to ask me, I tell you to get fucked The world only bad for things you construct
Carbon is rising, because you guys are sluts
You guys are Muts and we hate your guts
America is our king Most people think
Russia can go like a big dink
For your information people don’t have communication
People just suck like muck in the back of a truck
Sus
Kickin up leaves, kickin up dust, the world is slower if you must

Gaming is our life and gaming is a way everything has to do it with electronics in our modern day
Pollution sucks ass and it’s pretty gay (yay)
History is dead, because of our own plague
When people get bored, they start to jade
When I hook or leave my house, I’ve just been played
The society sucks today because of what we made

When the market crashes I’ll be deep deep in the woods
Or fishing on a lake, but not in no hoods
Gaming is a way of life and gaming is our way
People suck in our modern day (okay!)
Pollution sucks ass and it’s pretty gay (yeah?)
History is dead, because of our own plague
When people get bored, they just started to fade
When a hooker lose my house, I’ve just been played
This society sucks that we made here today
We are all doomed someday, doomed someday
De de de de de de de de de de fuck this, this is pretty gay Yay!!
