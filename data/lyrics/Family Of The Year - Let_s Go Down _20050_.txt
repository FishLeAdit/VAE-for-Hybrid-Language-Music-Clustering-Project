Let's go to the river
Let's go to the creek
Let's go down in the water
And cool off this hot week
Let's go down to the river
Let's go to the lake
Let's burn a fire and give this scene a break
Let's get out of the city
Let's go run in the street
Let's sit down in the holy water where the air is clear and clean
Maybe Seb and you can
Grab some firewood
And me and Vi will take car of the booze
And Hannah and Brad will be good company
Let's go to the river
Let's go to the lake
Let's drink some holy water and get ourselves
Erased
Let's go to the river
Let's go to the creek
Let's go down in the water and cool off this hot week
Grab the old guitar and your mama's blanket
And a book about serial killers that I can read
(read read read)
And don't forget to bring...
(oooooooo)
Let's stay in this spot and we're better off dead
(dead dead dead)
Let's go to the water and praise the gates
With a sheen
Let's go out to the country
Where the sky is blue and the grass is green
First i take my shoes off then i take my socks off
Doesn't even matter where rocks that we can jump off
Try and stop me nobody can stop me
Coconut juices tearing down my body
Let'd go to the gutter
Let's go to down in the train
Let's get the hell outta here before we drive ourselves insane
Let's go to the river
Let's go to the creek
Let's go down in the water to wash off this dirty week
Let's go to the water x2
