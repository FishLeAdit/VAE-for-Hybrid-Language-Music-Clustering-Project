Madison new wave hippies
Hugging all kinds of trees
Living in mostly cities
Talking with eyes closed, never in trouble
It's like a new disease

New wave hippies don't protest
They do it on little screens
Recovering 90's ravers
And people who bought the wrong jeans
Occasional psychos, but mostly just nice folk
It's like a new disease
Fed up 'bout new wave hippies

New wave hippies do song and dance
But they don't say anything
An entirе generation
With no one to bеlieve
They talk about flowers and berries and trees
They name check folk artists and sing with a sneeze
It's like a new disease
Fed up 'bout new wave hippies
