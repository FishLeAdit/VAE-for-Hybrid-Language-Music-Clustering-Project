Chocolate makes you happy
And it keeps you awake
As you unbutton your top pants button
Bewildered by the pain
Oh, oh, oh
Chocolate makes you happy
As you deign to sing along
When you thrust your fingers
Down your throat and
Wash away what's wrong
Oh, oh, oh

Out of your mind with happiness
Incredibly dumb, incredibly ugly
To have die the one you await for
All that you sign all that you sign
And wait for

Out of your mind with whorishness
Incredibly young, incredibly filthy
Oh, to curse both your life and death
Oh to curse life, oh to curse life
And death

Chocolate makes you happy
And it keeps you awake
As you unbutton
Your top pants button
Bewildered by the pain
Oh, oh, oh
Chocolate makes you happy
Like a credit to the race
As you ruminate in the arms of coco
On the fatness of your face

Out of your mind with slavishness
Rough, close and cold
Rough, close and cold
To have died the one you await for
All that you sign, blush, wish and pray for

Out of your mind embarrassment
Out of your mind
Out of your mind
Out of your mind out of

Chocolate makes you happy
And it keeps you awake
As you unbutton
Your elaborate garter
Bewildered by desire
Oh, oh, oh
