Uh

I got some things that keep on runnin' through my mental
Like why you keep on complicatin' life? This shit is simple
Break it down, let me tell you the essentials
Write a rap, record and document so it's official
Law one
Doesn't matter black, white, brown, rich, gay, straight, poor
You gon' end up in the ground 'bout six feet down
You might live 'til you a hundred
Or you might never make it out to see it past your twenties
Slow it down, son, I know the world is fast-paced
That's why I'm out here tryna live it like my last day
Two
Can't express this one any clearer
You can lie to the world, but not the man in the mirror
So keep it real with yourself
I'm watchin' people plummet 'cause they dumb and never keep it one hundred
Number three
Every man and woman gotta eat
Don't be ashamed 'bout what you do to get your money every week
I don't care if you a nurse or a blue-collar work
Or you doing overnights up at McDonald's flippin' burgers
Number four
Always take care of your core
Talkin' family and your friends, loved ones you adore
It's law five
Be good to your body and mind
Treat it right 'cause that's the only way you survive
All the pills, coke, dope, smoke, fast food, no joke
Alcohol will kill you, leave your body dry with no hope
Six
I won't lie, this one is a challenge
But everything you do in life is all about balance
Man, too much of anything is not a good thing
So be careful what you do and what it could bring
Number seven isn't easy, but I swear it needs to happen
Cut the people out in life that only causin' you distractions
I don't give a fuck if it be friends or it be family
All that energy that's negative is nothin' but a cancer
Number eight
I'ma go and tell you it straight
Bein' insecure's your main reason for hate
Number nine, number nine, what a time to be alive
Don't forget it, it's a blessin' that you open up your eyes
Every mornin', it's important just to know it, never shake it off
Number ten, take it all with a grain of salt
Even what I said
Form your own opinion and get it through your head
No one's got the answer, we just learnin' as we live
No one gave me shit, I had to teach myself to give
No one gave me shit, I had to teach myself to give
