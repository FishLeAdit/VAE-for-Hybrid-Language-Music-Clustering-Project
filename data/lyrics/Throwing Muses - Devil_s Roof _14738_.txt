I have two heads
Where's the man, he's late
One burns, one's sky
Where's the man, he's late
I'm two headed
One free, one sticky
But is it freedom can burn?
Is sticky ever blue?
For instance where's my husband?

This is what I need
Why I can't stay
God, this is the devil
Too bad he is late
I love the smell of beer
The smell of dark, the feel of dark, to feel the rug
To press the rug beneath me
A small party
But is it sinners can burn?
I hear we let them speak
For instance where's my husband?

If you're my husband, I tell you something
Dance on the devil's roof
Under a devil's moon
I don't care and you don't—
Dance on the devil's roof
Under a devil's moon
I don't care and you don't—
Dance on the devil's roof
Under a devil's moon
I don't care and you don't move
