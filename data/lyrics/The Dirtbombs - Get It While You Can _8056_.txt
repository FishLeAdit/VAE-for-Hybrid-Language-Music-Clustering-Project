Don't wanna sound apocalyptic
But you know nothing lasts forever
Something could scream across the ecliptic
And there goes all our lovely weather
You better get it while you can
You better get it while you can
Don't wanna seem pessimistic
But they say you can't take it with you
You could become a statistic
And there'd be no one left to miss you
You better get it while you can
You better get it while you can
It's all a matter of your perspective
You change it like a tv channel
Don't wanna sound apocalyptic
But you know nothing lasts forever
Something could scream across the ecliptic
And there goes all our lovely weather
You better get it while you can
You better get it while you can
Don't wanna sound pessimistic
