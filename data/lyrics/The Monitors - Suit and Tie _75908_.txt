It was a
(Saturday night)
Rough of the border
Waitin' in line to make an order
Gutter punk bitches at the taco truck
(We ain't want no  tacos, man, we're here for a fuck)

That was my first mistake
She had the beans but she should've had the steak
And the sound from her underwear
And the smell that hit the air

She was a shit machine
It wouldn't stop
She pulled her panties down and I heard it drop
Shit machine sluts
What a disgrace
Exploding diarrhea all over the place

After that, I triеd her again
All cleaned up and shе even had a friend
Back at my place, she started to smile
I start diggin' in their buttholes like it's goin' out of style

That was another mistake
The ground shook and it started to shake
Then the sound from her underwear
And the smell hit the air

Ba-ba-boom
The smell hit the room
Now I'm covered in her gutter punk perfume
Shit lovin' sluts
What do I doo-doo?
She's gaga for my caca
And goo-goo for my poo-poo
Let's go!

She's gaga for my caca
And goo-goo for my poo-poo

Shit machines
It wouldn't stop
She pulled her panties down and I heard it drop
Shit machine sluts
What a disgrace
Exploding diarrhea all over the place
Shit machines
I'm covered in slop
All over my chest
It started to drop
Shit machine sluts
What do I doo-doo?
She's gaga for my caca
And goo-goo for my poo-poo
(Shit machine)
Gaga for my caca
(Shit machine)
And goo-goo for my poo-poo
(Shit machine)
What do I doo-doo?
She's gaga for my caca
And goo-goo for my poo-poo
