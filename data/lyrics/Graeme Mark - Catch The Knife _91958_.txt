The world's throwing rocks at me
It's time to pick up your arms
I love what you want to be
But I don't love what you are
You are the dreamer, not the dream
You are the gleaner, not the farmer
You're like the river, like the stream
You're the snake, not the charmer
O Jeannie, please deliver me
Yours will be my last breath
If only you could forgive me
We'll fight the world to the best
And that's when you say
Why would I try to catch a knife that was falling
Why would I spill my own blood on your blade
Why would I answer if I heard the wolves calling
And why would I try to change you
Why would I try to change you
The world's firing back at us
Are you ready to kill
I loved all your promises
But most remain unfulfilled
You are the gatherer, not the hunter
You are the coffee cup, not the hand
And though I know how much you want her
You are the curse, not the land
And I've got to live with my decisions
I've got to learn from my mistakes
But last night I had a vision
I saw my head on your plate
And that's when you say
Why would I try to catch a knife that was falling
Why would I spill my own blood on your blade
Why would I answer if I heard the wolves calling
And why would I try to change you
Why would I try to change you
Why would I try
O why would I try
Why would I try
