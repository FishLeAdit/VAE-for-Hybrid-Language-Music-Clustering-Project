If you can find a drop in a drying sea
You'll find light in the darkest creeks
Past the pain lies the keys to Heaven
There's still life in the armageddon
If you can see the spark on a salty cheek
You'll find calm in the apathy
You'll see growth in the vast depression
Pain is love at it's very essence

Then you told me
Yeah, you told me

I feel it in the wind, my dear
The sun is gonna reappear
Good days are gonna come along
Hold on, hold on
I feel it in the wind, my love
The sky is gonna clear above
Good days are gonna come along
Hold on

If you can hеar the sound of a heart that grievеs
I'll be dammed that it still believes
Past the pain lies the keys to Heaven
There's still life in the armageddon

Then you told me
Yeah, you told me

I feel it in the wind, my dear
The sun is gonna reappear
Good days are gonna come along
Hold on, hold on
I feel it in the wind, my love
The sky is gonna clear above
Good days are gonna come along
Hold on

I feel it coming, the tide is turning
I feel it coming, you just got to wait and believe
I feel it coming, the tide is turning
I feel it coming, you just got to wait and believe
I feel it coming, the tide is turning
I feel it coming, you just got to wait and believe
I feel it coming, the tide is turning, oh

I feel it in the wind, my dear
The sun is gonna reappear
Good days are gonna come along
Hold on, hold on
I feel it in the wind, my love
The sky is gonna clear above
Good days are gonna come along
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
