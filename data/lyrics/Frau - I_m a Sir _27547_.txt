I'd dress up like a sir, I’d dress up as a sir
Stick  on a mustache, a beard, and some speckles
And  put on a hat, like a sir
I'd step up like a sir, I'd step up as a sir
My queen shall lay her sword on my shoulders
As  I say my prayers to bless her
The  world would bloom as they shout out my name loud and clear
The skies will cheer for my life and the clouds will appear
To  see me, just to see me
And I’d be quite a legend for the next hundred years
My life would never be ever so sad and no tears
Would trickle down my cheeks and my eyes
I'd  dress up like a sir, I'd dress up as a sir
Stick on a mustache, a beard, and some speckles
And put on a hat, like a sir
I'd step up like a sir, I'd step up as a sir
My queen shall lay her sword on my shoulders
As I say my prayers to bless her
