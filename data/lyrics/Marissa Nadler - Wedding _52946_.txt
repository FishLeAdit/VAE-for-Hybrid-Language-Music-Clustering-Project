When you land, I'll be around
I'll wait for you to come around
When you land, I'll be around
I'll wait for you to come around

Give me a chance, I'll make you a ring
And we'll fly to our wedding
Give me a chance, I'll make you sing
And we'll fly to our wedding

When you rise, I'll be around
I'll wait for you to come around
And when you land, I'll be around
I'll wait for you to come around

Give me a chance, I'll make you a ring
And we'll fly to our wedding
Give me a chance, I'll make you a ring
And we'll fly to our wedding
