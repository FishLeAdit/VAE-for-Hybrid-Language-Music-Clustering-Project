People try to tell me
What they think is right for me
Think there's some value
To what they got to say
But I won't listen to them
Don't need their advice
I wouldn't ever have it
Any other fucking way

Can't tell no one
No you can't tell no one
No you can't tell no one
No you can't tell no one
What to do!

Rules are made for idiots
People that can't think
I'm treated like I don't
Have a mind of my own
Stupid fucking idiots
With stupid fucking ideals
When will they ever
Fucking leave me alone

Can't tell no one
No you can't tell no one
No you can't tell no one
No you can't tell no one
What to do!
