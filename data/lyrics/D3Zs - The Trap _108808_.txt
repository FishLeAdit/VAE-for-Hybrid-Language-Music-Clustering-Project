Heart made of stone, gettin' throat from a succubus
Put the barrel in her mouth, bitch, suck on this
Bad foreign bitch, dick suckin' lips
Big fuckin' tits, bitch, holy shit
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah (
Heaven or Hell
)
Yeah, uh, yeah, woah (Let's rock)
(L-L-L3Ft 4 D3aD mixtape)

Rick Owens trench coat, Deus Ex
Twin GLOCKs sing duets, make a bloody mess
Grim reaper, black hoodie, DRKSHDW silhouette
Big ass sword on the chop, bloody bayonet
Chrome bloody crucifix
Bro geeked on Percocets
Fent 30, kiss of death
Don't know who gon' die next
Clothes, money, drugs and sex
Hoes, got 'em soakin' wet
Hoes choosin' on me, yep
Nose runny, coke and X (
Fuck you
)
Sloppy throat from your ho, bro, I know you sick
Your bitch on go, you ain't know, boy, I know you pissed
Blow up my phone, leave me 'lone, ho, you so unhinged
Come get your ho, she on me like you don't exist
Run through her walls like a ghost, your bitch so possessed
Say you get dough, but you broke, boy, I know you stressed
Dark evil thoughts, swear these hoes so fucked in the head
Neck and wrist froze, my heart cold, I feel like snowman
Lights out like bulbs, diamonds glow like some fuckin' lamps
My balls and my word, break 'em for no man
Heart made of stone, gettin' throat from a succubus
Put the barrel in her mouth, bitch, suck on this
Bad foreign bitch, dick suckin' lips
Big fuckin' tits, bitch, holy shit
We pull up, Hellcat, eyes glowin' red
Do donuts, spinnin' blocks like a pirouette
We ain't gon' duck, shotgun blast like the pyramids
We get lows, hit the mall with like forty bands
Doors lift up, car transform just like Optimus
Sassafras, molly rock, brown like fuckin' sand (
This is too easy
)
Rick hoodie, hood on my head like Darth Sidious
Walk in the room, high-end clothes, got unspoken rizz
Futuristic scope on the gun, shootin' shit like Gantz
Blow through the breeze, bullets blow through the fuckin' wind
Chrome Hearts tee, roar jeans look so heaven-sent
Angels fall from the sky, Neon Genesis
Got like ten pounds of shrooms in the hippie van
Big ass shroom, it's the size of my fuckin' head
Ketamine, Crystal Castles
Spike knuckles, bloody fists
Wrist frozen like Alaska
Geeked on shroom chocolates
Paint her walls, Sistine Chapel
Pull off in that Porsche, skedaddle
Orange dodge, Dukes of Hazzard
Engine roarin', pterodactyl
Black Chrome trench, twin chops just like fuckin' Axl
In the field, catching plays, try to blitz 'em, bullets tackle
Pussy grippin' like a grapple
Rick Owens Geobaskets
Vivienne globe 'round my neck, look like fuckin' Saturn
Geeked in the Wraith, gettin' brain, your bitch throat get splattered
Bitch suck up me and my bros and kiss you after
Back of the Wraith, feedin' K to a fuckin' stallion
Two cups stuffed, pourin' blood like a fuckin' fountain
Rick Owens suit, pourin' blood with my vamp battalion
Rick Owens boots, spill the blood on this fuckin' fashion
So many racks, damn, I think I need an accountant
Bitch know I'm him, I walk in, take his ho, no challenge

This is too easy
