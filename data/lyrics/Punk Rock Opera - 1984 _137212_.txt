Sound system gonna bring me back up
Yeah, one thing that I can depend on
Sound system gonna bring me back up
Right, one thing that I can depend on
A chair and a table by the window in the room
The light there reveals that it’s gonna be dark soon
Drinking in the streets with three bottle of gin
The wind is blowing harder and the walls are closing in
Walk into the corner with the vagrant and the cop inside a store they both bought bottles and they drink until they drop
Seeing through the present is like looking at a wall
Pessimism is gonna be the death of us all
Sound system gonna bring me back up
Right, one thing that I can depend on
Sound system gonna bring me back up
Yeah, one thing that I can depend on

Sound system (up, up, up!)
Sound! System! Sound! System!
Wake up, turn my box on, bust the shade, let the sun in (sound system!)
Times are getting tougher, 'bout time to start running (sound system!)
Box in my hand, music by my side (sound system!)
Nothin' feels better when music's by my side
Sound system gonna bring me back up
That's right, one thing that I can depend on
Sound system gonna bring me back up
Right, one thing that I can depend on
(Sound system!) Music's gonna bring me back up!
