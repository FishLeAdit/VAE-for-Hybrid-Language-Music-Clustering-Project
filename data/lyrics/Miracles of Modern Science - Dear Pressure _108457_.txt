Hey friend, I haven't seen you much
It's my fault, I've been so out of touch
New club? No, you go on ahead
Old blood, I'll dance when I am dead
When I'm dead
I'll dance when I'm dead
That was a killer show (Killer show)
Makes sense to take it on the road
Not me! I can't afford the risk
You tour, I'm on the mailing list
Go ahead
I'll tour when I'm dead
I don't know what else to say
I don't know what else to say
Maybe I'll get to it someday
I see myself at 94
Spare dreams stuck on life support
No wait, if that's what lies ahead
I'll change or put it off and dream when I'm dead
I don't know what else to say
End all my thoughts the same way:
"Maybe I'll get to it someday"
I've been so drunk on safety
I think I'm going crazy
Don't want my ghost to hate me
Time's running
