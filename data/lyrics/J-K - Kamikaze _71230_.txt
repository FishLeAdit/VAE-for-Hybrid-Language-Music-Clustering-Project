When I pop out, leave you flat like how a tire work
When you hear that pa-pa-pa, it ain't fireworks
They killed my brothers, numb the pain I been buyin' percs
Get it brackin' anywhere, keep pole inside church
Big 40, Shawn Kemp, no kamikaze
Run up on you, hair flashin', like paparazzi
I swear I hate niggas, I am not a Nazi
Niggas cry baby, and they whine, like Callarazi

Big chops and we move like the military
Yo' homies still ain't slid, you niggas still scary?
Cut some niggas off, them niggas drill rarely
I be touchin' dough like it's pillsberry
I'ma leave it to the top, I can never follow
I just mеt a model, coulda fucked, but I left thе bottle
Tell myself, i'll get that check, rest in price hollows
I be sendin' shells, I sold a taco to my Mexicano
Niggas want beef, I leave yo' bowl empty, that pole wit' me
And I keep them shooters that gone blow wit' me
Big B's what it is, so I won't feel it
I'm so rigid, bitch gone suck dick 'till her throat itchin'
Why that 40 always kick, like a cage fight
Tryna fight, I hit you wit' toy, I don't play right
Great white, i'll bite, in the daylight
Ain't nice, pop up at yo' show, give you stage fright

When I pop out, leave you flat like how a tire work
When you hear that pa-pa-pa, it ain't fireworks
They killed my brothers, numb the pain I been buyin' percs
Get it brackin' anywhere, keep pole inside church
Big 40, Shawn Kemp, no kamikaze
Run up on you, hair flashin', like paparazzi
I swear I hate niggas, I am not a Nazi
Niggas cry baby, and they whine, like Callarazi

Aye, yea, Bitch it's my turn
Pull up with the heater, call it usher how I let it burn
Niggas steady playin' like they never learn
Shit, life is not a game, ain't no edge or turns
Big bankrolls, it's all we ever chase
Get behind that mask, young nigga look like leatherface
It's a V.I.P, over here we call it Section 8
Nigga play wit' me and i'ma hand out expiration dates
Pull up on yo set, aye, they know who we be
Cut some niggas off, now they sick they gotta see me eat
Runnin' to that bag, can't be runnin' wit' no sleepy feet
Free my other brothers they was spinnin' like a DVD
Yeah, bitch you not about it
Know we got that bag, pull the choppa out it
Niggas play wit' us we on yo' block about it
Hit 'em in the head in case he thought about it

When I pop out, leave you flat like how a tire work
When you hear that pa-pa-pa, it ain't fireworks
They killed my brothers, numb the pain I been buyin' percs
Get it brackin' anywhere, keep pole inside church
Big 40, Shawn Kemp, no kamikaze
Run up on you, hair flashin, like paparazzi
I swear I hate niggas, I am not a Nazi
Niggas cry baby, and they whine, like Callarazi

I'm the big homie, to yo big homie, huh
Big 40 on me who gone pick on me, huh
When you in this funk ain't no pics on me, huh
Slide thru' the 'ops corner store with that stick on me, huh
When they took my nigga from me, I dropped 100 that same night
No ski mask, no beanie on, dropped a whole 100 in plain sight
That's what you call funk on sight
Nigga I been funkin' my whole life
Can't get back my bro life
That fucked up my whole life
I only loves my 2 kids, huh
She ain't hold it down when I did them 2 vids, huh
Can't put no trust up in no bitch, huh
Real niggas from Seminary to Fruitridge, huh
It's phill

When I pop out, leave you flat like how a tire work
When you hear that pa-pa-pa, it ain't fireworks
They killed my brothers, numb the pain I been buyin' percs
Get it brackin' anywhere, keep pole inside church
Big 40, Shawn Kemp, no kamikaze
Run up on you, hair flashin', like paparazzi
I swear I hate niggas, I am not a Nazi
Niggas cry baby, and they whine, like Callarazi
