Honestly what difference could this all possibly make?
In the end, we're all going to roughly the very same place
And soon we'll be dead or in pain half-alive mostly dead in our minds and unwilling to try to revive what we lost when we tried to survive the first time

And how do you propose to change it
When you play it so lackadaisical?
How do you expect to make it
If you're gonna act so lackadaisical?

You ought to do it right the first time
You should've done it right the first time
Just let it go by the wayside

Honestly what difference could this conceivably make?
All my dreams keep collapsing and crushing my heart like a pancake
And soon you'll be dead or you'll marry instead, get a house and a kid, keep your feelings well-hid, and I won't want to know if you loved me, so what if you did?

But how do I propose to change it
When I play it so lackadaisical?
How do I expect to make it
If I'm gonna act so lackadaisical?

I ought to do it right the first time
I should've done it right the first time
And there you go by the wayside
