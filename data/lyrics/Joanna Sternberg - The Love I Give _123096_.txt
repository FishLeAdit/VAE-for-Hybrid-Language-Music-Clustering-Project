I give all my love to you
It doesn't matter who you are
It's not anything new
Though I barely get none back
That does not erase the fact
I will give and I will give my love to you
I will give, I will give my love to you
I give all my love to you
Though my hearts been broke a thousand times in two
And yes that should make me stop
But in fact it's quite the opposite
I give and I will give my love to you
I will give, I will give my love to you
And all the time
And the energy I could be saving
My crime, is love
And if I see
Your face before me in all my dreams
It's fine just fine
Tell me how, can you hear me
All the times that I helped you but you didn't see
That maybe I'm human too
But what more can I do
I will give and I will give my love to you
I will give, I will give
I will give, I will give
I will give, I will give my love to you
