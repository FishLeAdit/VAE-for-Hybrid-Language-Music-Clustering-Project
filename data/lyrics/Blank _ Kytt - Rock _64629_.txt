Patiently listenin'
You're keepin' your distance, but
I was still hoping that we could be friends
But if that's too much then I'll ask no more than
This which we've buried
Yes I had one once but I guess she's married
And, yes, I have a photograph, somewhere
Don't ask, I'll tell
If you really wanna know that bad

Isn't she beautiful?
Isn't she beautiful?
I know, I know
Isn't she

We're all pretty when we die
Prim and pale in black and white, white, oh
Go and put on your perfume
Smile away the afternoon, noon

Well your brother got married to a faithless harness
Traded his drums for angels' voices
Ah ah ah
Shotgun wedding on the porch
On the fifth of May
And everybody sayin' yeah, they'll be okay
They're so great
They're so nice together
You're the happy couple, may you die together

May you prosper 'till you die
Prim and pale in black and white, white oh
May we dance until it rains
May we drink to hide our shame, shame oh

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

We're all pretty when we die
Prim and pale in black and white, white
Go and put on your perfume
Smile away the afternoon, noon
