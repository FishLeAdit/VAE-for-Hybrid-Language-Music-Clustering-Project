Yeah
Uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah
(Zerby)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

I've been, runnin' out of time, I ain't looking at the clock (Yeah)
Tryna' make this money, is you with me or you not? (Yeah)
You told me you would ride, but you sat back and you just plot (Yeah)
I gotta keep my distance now, 'cause I don't trust you now
I gotta watch you now, 'cause you don't— (Shh)
Ain't gotta say no names, ain't gotta play no games
I'm a stand up guy, I stand on business fosho' (Yeah)
But you know

This a different type of lifestyle
Shorty wanna hang with me, she wanna come home right now
I tell her "Pipe down", but will get the pipe now
'Cause when we walk around, gotta stay safe out of town (Uh)
I got the right ambition, I got the right intentions
I tell them to "Shut up, listen"
I'm knowin' what I'm doing, they play me like I'm stupid
But then I go and make it, that's why I'm thumbing through it
I give 'em real swag, I give 'em real sauce
I give 'em real knowledge, that's something you don't got
All of my brothers winning, I take 'em to the top (Top)
Their pockets full of knots, niggas know it's All We Got
Pussy

I've been, runnin' out of time, I ain't looking at the clock (Yeah)

I gotta keep my distance now, 'cause I don't trust you now
I gotta watch you now, 'cause you don't— (Shh)
Ain't gotta say no names, ain't gotta play no games
I'm a stand up guy, I stand on business fosho' (Yeah, yeah)
But you know

I'm walking through the storm and them raindrops
Thinking in my head, wondering will all the pain stop?
Fightin' this anxiety, wondering will the fame stop?
Paranoia in my brain, I'm quick to let that thang pop
I ain't worried 'bout them niggas, I be in a different space
How you telling me you love me but you lyin' to my face?
I was talking to my lawyer, pray to God I beat that case
Tryna' get back on this road and go get straight back to that pape'
I got people asking questions, wondering "Can they get cake?"
Nigga, no, you can't get nothing, you ain't help in the first place
And you know that you was wrong but I still helped make sure you straight
If I ain't fucking with you nigga, I'ma tell you to your face
Pussy

I've been, runnin' out of time, I ain't looking at the clock (Yeah)
