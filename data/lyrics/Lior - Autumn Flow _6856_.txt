Oh feels like autumns back again so soon
I see my father turning grey under a silver moon
Dont remember when
He was a young man anymore
Well thats too long ago
Suddenly Id be asking you
If you'll love me all the time
Even when the diamond loses its shine
Whoa whoa yeah
The heaviness of loss
The weightlessness of a baby boy
The despair and imminent joy
You know temptation only shows yer one side of its face
Gotta make sure you see the other before you join the rat race
Dont know why Im so happy to take care of you
But Ive learnt to go with the flow
And thats what the flow wants to do
So I dont need to tell you do I my girl
That you are sunshine you're everything good in a world
Well you know I'm thinking about myself less and less
Only holler if its SOS
Taking bigger steps to get to you
Happy to sit her and watch you and I grow
And bathe in this sweet autumn flow
You know temptation only shows yer one side of its face
Gotta make sure you see the other before you join the rat race
Dont know why I'm so happy to take care of you
But Ive learnt to go with the flow
And thats what the flow wants to do
