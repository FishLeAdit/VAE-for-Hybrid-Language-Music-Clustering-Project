Click Click - Bang Bang
And you're never gonna be the same
Click Click - Bang Bang
And your heart starts beating like the pouring rain
Click Click - Bang Bang
And the blood says goodbye to the veins
Click Click - Bang Bang
And you're never gonna see me again
(Everybody wants to save you)
Yes, I know and I sure do thank you
(Why can't you love, like you ought to?)
Well, I'm not sure that I want to
Click Click - Bang Bang
And it all goes away
Nothing left but a memory of a love that used to be
And my hearts a gravestone
Marks the rest of another unknown
No name just a final saying
Written in the rock, click click bang bang
(Everybody wants to save you)
Yes, I know and I sure do thank you
(Why can't you love, like you ought to?)
Well, I'm not sure that I want to
And I've never been afraid of broken hearts
Click Click - Bang Bang
And you're never gonna be the same
Click Click - Bang Bang
And you're never gonna be the same
Click Click - Bang Bang
Click Click - Bang Bang
Click Click - Bang Bang
Click Click - Bang Bang
(Everybody wants to save you)
Yes, I know and I sure do thank you
(Why can't you love, like you ought to?)
Well, I'm not sure that I want to
Well, I'm not sure that I want to
