Paraty paradise
Parachute into my life
Paraty, paradise exists
Morning sun on the lazy beach
Waterfalls awaiting
Take a swim in the salty sea
Coconut and açai
Mango juice and coffee
Take a sip, take some time to be
Paraty pirateman
Parasail to the island
Paraty paradise
Parachute into my life
Paraty, paradise exists
Paraty, paradise exists
Bare feet in the sand
Take a walk up the ancient path
Through the jungle leaves and vines and roots
Butterflies, blue and red
Lead the way overhead
To the river water, sweet and fresh
Paraty paradise
Parachute into my life
Paraty, paradise exists
Paraty, paradise exists
Paraty, paradise exists
