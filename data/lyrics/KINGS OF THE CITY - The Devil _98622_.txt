He put the Devil inside of you
He put the Devil inside of you
And you like it
Inside of you
You're so alone
So alone
But inside of you
He put the devil

It was the full moon's desire that I met Trixy
She would always powder her nose as she got tipsy
I said it's Sunday night
She said I'll pull a sicky
And there you have it
The start of another night of mischief
Looking at my history
All I gotta do is drop a couple lines and they're frisky
Bad minded in the city
Preying on her brain
With no shame for my gain
She got the Devil in her baby
Yeah she whispers save me from this game

He put the Devil inside of you
He put the Devil inside of you
And you like it
Inside of you
You're so alone
So alone
But inside of you
He put the devil

He's diabolic
Gave a desire promise
She'll be dying to live
Now she's dying from it
Burning in hell trying to rise above it
But when you're fighting fire with fire, the fire loves it
He told her just blaze, your memory will miss days
You wanna live your life free?
It pays to be risque
She made the mistake thinking that she could escape
But this maze just one of six hundred and sixty six ways

He put the Devil inside of you
He put the Devil inside of you
And you like it
Inside of you
You're so alone
So alone
But inside of you
He put the devil
Inside of you
Inside of you
