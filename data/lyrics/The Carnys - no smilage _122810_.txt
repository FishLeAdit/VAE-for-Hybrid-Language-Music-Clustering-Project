Smile! No one cares how you feel
Be vicious, vain, and vile
Everything's yours to steal if you'll just smile
Have you no dignity?
Have you no sense of style?
You'll never be pretty until you smile
Smile! No one cares how you feel
There's a world to beguile
You can make this world kneel if you'll just smile
Always the best disguise
A license to defile
Everyone you despise will die, so smile!
