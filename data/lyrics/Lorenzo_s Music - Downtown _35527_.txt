We been runnin' round goin' downtown
Downtown downtown
Something got visual KO
I dig it fast
So your gonna phone it
And then a who can not feel the same?
Chasin' tail away we go
And do you want say come
From wrongs and spills
Come home but don't stay dumb for long
Long sent home from Boston
Don't fall horsey
Don't say
We been runnin' round goin' downtown
Downtown downtown
Announce a need
It's not a form
Not a phone
He knows it ain't no location
He knows I'm on
Let him go
Let him go
Boy, yeah
Boy, you know
It ends already
It ends alright
We been runnin' round goin' downtown
Downtown downtown
