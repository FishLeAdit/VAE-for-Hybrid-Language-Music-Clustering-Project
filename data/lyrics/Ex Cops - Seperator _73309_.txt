(Verse)
In another way you’re going home
I could always at night with you
(Bridge)
‘Cause we will try to step
Our wasted paths
Give it all a try into the dark
(Chorus)
Let’s take the way up, let’s take the way up
I could never stand myself sleeping
I don’t wanna begin
I might die
(Verse)
There were times when you can’t speak
When you shy away from color TV
(Bridge)
‘Cause you were trying to step
Away from light
Bring this the sole one out and I remember
(Chorus)
Let’s take the way up, let’s take the way up
I could never stand myself sleeping
I don’t wanna begin
I might die
(Verse)
Let’s take the way up, let’s take the way up
I could never see my heart breaking
I won’t, I won’t, I won’t
I might die
