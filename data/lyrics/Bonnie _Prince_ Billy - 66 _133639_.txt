She who remained in the depth of my being
In the twilight of gleams and glimpses
She who'd never smiled
She who had never smiled or given it up in the morning
Will be my last gift to you
Folded into the last song
Words have wooed her, but haven't won her
Persuasion has reached to her, but come up empty
And I've gone from country to country
Keeping her in the core of my heart
And around have risen and fallen the growth and decay of my life
And all of my thoughts and actions, my slumbers and dreams
She ruled, yet dwelled alone and apart
And she stayed alone in whatever you call it
Waiting for you to see her
I found a joy of my own
I found a joy of my own
I found a joy of my own
I found a joy of my own
I found a joy of my own
I found a joy of my own
I found a joy of my own
I found a joy of my own
