What will she say, when he's away?
What will she do?
And where will she go down in Mexico?
What can she take when he's away?
And then he calls
As she's gone out the door
What can he think
When his mind is on the blink?
Waking up to the sound of Ciudad
Thinking of her
I'll meet you in L.A
I'll kiss you in L.A
Why does she cry as the sun passes by?
Where does it go down in Tupelo?
And then he stares
As he loses his red hair
In the cold morning air
And where shall she go down in Mexico?
Where she can be free?
What can he think
When his head is in the sink?
Thinking of her
I'll meet you in L.A
I'll kiss you in L.A
