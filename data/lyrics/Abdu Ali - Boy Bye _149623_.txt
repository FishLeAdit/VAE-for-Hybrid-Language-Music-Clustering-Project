Tell me where to go?
You're giving me the cold shoulder
I don't know where to you want me to go
But that ego needs to move over

Stop playing games like I got time
To be trapped in your vanity
Your  instagram unfollowed me, preach
Nigga believe me, I'm like a 
I got to breath, I got to breathe
But everytime you come in my life
I can't be free
You need to tell me what it is
So I can go about my beef
Fuck I did here
I ain't no fucking kid
What it is, yo? What it is, yo?

Tell me where to go?
You're giving me the cold shoulder
I don't know where to you want me to go
But that ego needs to move over
