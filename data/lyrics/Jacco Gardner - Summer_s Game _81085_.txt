Summer days are at my door
It won't be like before
The wind blows softly through my room
Summer dreams are in the air
Some place but I don't know where
I feel I'll find her pretty soon
Memories keep rushing by
And I always wonder why
I've got to make myself believe
Things will always be the same
All I'll play is a summer's game
Golden sunlight at the sea
