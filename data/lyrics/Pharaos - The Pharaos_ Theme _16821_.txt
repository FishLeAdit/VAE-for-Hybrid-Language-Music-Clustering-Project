Man I gotta tell you a whole lotta shit, nigga I'm finna be back in a minute, you hear me mane, 10 toes down in the compound, you hear me mane, we finna run this shit up, big drank, big chain, big all that, you hear me, man we back mane, skeee
Skeee, stupid bitch, free the fourth nigga
Long live Jaques, I'm forever throwing fours
War for my brother, nigga, anything goes
Glocky on by my bedside, she sleep with me
If it's Funk, I call Mase, that nigga finna tweak with me
Sucker switched then died up
They don't want no beef with us
Real za, fire up and watch that bitch beat niggas
I got Veto on my mind, I had to cum in Jadaway
You know who really finna slide
We got them pussies out our face
I done been through detrimental shit and I'm still the same
You had one mishap and got a sex change
Ghetto fabulous, I might pull up in stretch rings
We done dropped the low team, get you left gang
I'm on percs and on mud, I don't feel pain
When a nigga sober up, that shit still pain
You know the Chang stood outside and felt the real rain
I had so many fake family when I deal the 'caine
You look into your eyes
I see you never been through it
I be rapping real life, brodie call it theme music
Never let no shit faze me, watch your head, keep movin'
Have faith in yourself, nigga you'll see through it
Never let no shit faze me, watch your head, keep movin'
Have faith in yourself, nigga you'll see through it
I ain't really been the same since I lost my sis
Her baby daddy took her life then he killed they kid
Couple managers I had did some shady biz
I cut myself then got them niggas out my radius
Twenty Bro ate a headshot, that nigga blessed
Slide through and hit your dog up, he need a vet
And even though I'm full of shots, I always still hold it back
I can't let my three babies ever see a nigga crack
I'm a man of my word, stand on loyalty
The thing jam up, all you gotta do is oil it
You a (?), I'll never turn my back on you
Even for the cheese, I will never turn a rat on you
You been playin' that shit out, you know the people watch
Nigga ended in the box, he ain't think a lot
Shawty (?) tryna make a band, he really be with chop
Got this burner in my hand like the sink was hot
You look into your eyes
I see you never been through it
I be rapping real life, brodie call it theme music
Never let no shit faze me, watch your head, keep movin'
Have faith in yourself, nigga you'll see through it
Never let no shit faze me, watch your head, keep movin'
Have faith in yourself, nigga you'll see through it
