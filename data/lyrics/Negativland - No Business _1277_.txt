There's no business like stealing
Like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
Stealing everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling
When you are stealing people like show people
There's no stealing like stealing show people
The headaches, the heartaches
The back aches, the flops
Even when you are stealing
The turkey that you know will fold
You may be stealing out in the cold
Then you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold
Let's go on with the stealing
Stealing
Stealing
And why
(Why, why, why, baby)
(Why, why, why, baby)
(Why, why, why, baby, woo!)
Because there's no business like stealing music I know
Angels come from everywhere with lots of music
And when you butcher it there's no attack
Where could you get music that you don't give back
And on top of that get that happy feeling
When you are stealing that extra music
Let's go on with the stealing
Why
(Why, why, why, baby)
(Why, why, why, baby)
(Why!)
Because there's no music like butcher music
Like no music I know
The music business people with lots of jack
They don't run out of dough
The music butcher
They gladly get paid for what they do
But they're stranded out in the cold
(Yeah!)
(Yeah!)
And why
(Why, why, why, baby)
And
The music
Music
Music butcher
(Woo, yeah, woo)
There's no business like no business
(Woo, woo)
(Why, why, why, baby)
(Woo!)
Because butcher music is so thrilling
Standing out in front on opening night
And you're stealing up there in lights
Smiling as you watch the music butcher
Butcher show music
Why
(Why, why, why)
And why
(Why, why, why, baby)
(Why, why, why, baby)
(Why!)
Because stealing
The music with the labels pasted on is appealing
Stealing everything that music business people don't allow
Yesterday they told you
Butcher music would not go far
That night you open and there you are
Stealing music
Let's go on with the
(Woo, woo)
On with the
(Woo, woo)
(Woo, woo)
Let's go on with stealing the show
