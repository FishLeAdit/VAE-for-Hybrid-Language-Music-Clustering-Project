I hitchhiked to the edge of town, and I came back home
I was scared to leave my poor mother alone
Don't wanna live here for the rest of my life
I'm gonna leave this town when momma dies

I'm on bed rest, I gotta give them wicked things
I've got it bad, I gotta kick them wicked things

I went to school to get a degree and now I'm buried in debt
I'm on pills for anxiety, I can't pay it back
My doctor says looking for the future is bad
I don't know what to do, I don't wanna look back

I'm on bed rest, I gotta give them wicked things
I've got it bad, I gotta kick them wicked things
One man can't be more than one thing
One man can't be more than one thing
I gotta kick them wicked things

Listen, my little brother killed a man in Fort McMurray
The light left his eyes in a hurry
The news said he put him down in a northern fury
He said he didn't kill him but he couldn't fool a jury

I'm on bed rest, I gotta kick them wicked things
I've got it bad, I gotta kick them wicked things
One man can't be more than one thing
One man can't be more than one thing
I gotta kick them, I gotta kick them
Yeah, I gotta kick them
Wicked things
