Here in Wainiha Valley, Valley
Lives our happy family, family
Banana trees sing in the breeze, soak up the sun
Green turns to yellow fruit for everyone
Papaya for Papa and Mama
Ripe avocado good for little one
Little one, little one
Learning to use her fingers, fingers
Playing with caterpillar, pillar
Rooster crows and baby knows it's time to wake
So much to learn today, she just can't wait
In the dawn, all is blue and turns to pink
Here comes Mama's milk so sweet to drink
So sweet to drink, so sweet to drink
Here in Wainiha Valley, Valley
Lives our happy family, family
The river flows fast and free from thе mountains
Joins the stream and then thе sea waves crashing
Down the way at Ke'e, we go swimming
Every day we watch the sunset, smiling
Smiling, smiling
Then back up into the valley, valley
We wash off our feet all salty and sandy
In the night, lightning strikes with thunder
Zigzags across the sky like fireworks
Like fireworks, like fireworks
