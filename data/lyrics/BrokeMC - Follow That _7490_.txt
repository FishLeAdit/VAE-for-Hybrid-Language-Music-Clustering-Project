She's swingin' Thor's Hammer, maybe sick of your manners
And I'm tryin' to make a point, as if the score matters
Slam. The door shatters. I'm hanging like some bored batters
Flying out at night just to watch the whores scatter
Sure. I tend to get stuck up in the rafters
Drifting with my thoughts, caught up in disasters;
Whirlpools of slander, hurricane slam dancers
Blur my brain faster, disturbing the gray matters
I play the same caper I've played since day one:
A plaster-cast bastard trying to stay out of the sun
Cool as alabaster, a pale-faced imitation
Stacking up my chips, getting cracks in my foundation
Until I found salvation in an hour-glass maiden
Took a sip and couldn't quit--I love the way she tasted
Couldn't flip the wasting, witness disintegration;
Cryptic communications got me twisted up and faded
So we build it up just to break it down
Thinking about thinking, getting over and around
We build it up just to break it down
As soon as we get up, we're thinking about getting down
When she laughs, she shakes the ground, so
Catch me sitting silent, trying to embrace the sound
I'm waking now, breaking down every detail I've found
Deciphering hieroglyphics--a pyro and a mystic
Missile silos stand, mimic the war of Roses and Cynics
But all's fair, I guess. Stack up the matches and gimmicks
We package each shipment to distract all the minions, and
It looks great from a distance, but there's cracks in the finish
I've mastered the method of packing up imperfections
Sweep dust under the carpet, a closet full of resurrections
Heart beneath the floorboards, brain in the freezer section
So I can ignore all the problems for my own greedy protection
The resulting situation's made of cheap imitations
Never gettin deep enough to complete the equation
All the numbers I get merely add to the frustration
'Cause I know if I call you up, I risk over-stimulation
This game of cat and mouse got me savage with doubt
I've got so much to say that I may never let get out
And part of me thinks I should just break down and speak
But Time is usually a better cure for this type of disease
Its never enough to ease the breakdown
Please never give up--my dreams are fake now
These treasures will rust. We need to break out
Sleep. Tremors. Combust. Bleed the pain out
So where you at?
Where's the bears and big cats?
What's the haps?
What damage is smashing your side of the map?
Lost in the woods
Bread crumbs swallowed by bats
Listen to your heart beat
How about you follow that
