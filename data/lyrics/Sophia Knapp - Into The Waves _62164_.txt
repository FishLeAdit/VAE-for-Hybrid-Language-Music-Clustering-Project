Love ... make me ...don't let me down
Summer love, dead in the winter, returning to the ground
And know the ocean always swirling...
... just a song
Wu-hu, summer ... it's all that I know
Time is now, necklace that you can hold or let go of
Know the world outside is calling, and we stop time
With just a song
We down in the ocean, things we never seen
So are you imagine, on the wave's that I'll be
Give you my heart, soft as...
Dance on my waves, are we ... uuuh
Into the waves
Dark smile, passing my window, heart beating fast
... down, tell me good things last
With just a song
We down in the ocean, things we never seen
So are you imagine, on the wave's that I'll be
Give you my heart, soft as...
Dance on my waves, are we ... uuuh, we'll do that baby
Into the waves
