I was dreamin' when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this mornin'
Could've sworn it was judgment day
The sky was all purple
There were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' 2 run from the destruction
U know I didn't even care
Say say
Two-thousand-zero-zero party over
Oops out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
(I was dreaming' when I wrote this)
(So sue me if I go 2 fast)
(Life is just a party, and parties weren't meant 2 last)
War is all around us, my mind says prepare 2 fight
So if I gotta die I'm gonna listen 2 my body tonight
Yeah
They say two-thousand-zero-zero party over
Oops out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party (u say) like it's 1999
Yeah, Yeah
"Lemme tell ya something'"
If U didn't come 2 party
Don't bother knockin' on my door
I got a lion in my pocket
And baby he's ready 2 roar
Yeah, Yeah
Everybody's got a bomb
We could all die any day
Ooohhw
But before I'll let that happen
I'll dance my life away
Oh, they say
Two thousand-zero-zero-party over
Oops out of time
We're runnin' outta time
(Tonight I'm gonna)
So tonight we gonna
(Party like it's 1999)
We gonna, oww
I just say it 1 more time
Two-thousand-zero-zero party over oops
Out of time

Yeah, yeah
So tonight we gonna (party like it's 1999)
We gonna, oww
Alright, it's 1999
You say it, 1999
