I could go out in the darkness hear you calling my name
I hear you shouting hear you calling but it's not the same
And every word that you are throwing right into my back
It doesn't matter to me because I'm keeping my track
Let me go
Stop talking, let me go
Our time together always ended up in war
Every whisper made you jealous and that from the start
It's nice to see you shouting after throwing me out
No excuses but this time it's gonna be the last
Let me go
Oh baby, let me go
Now I go out in the darkness smiling back at your face
With a nice and cozy feeling after leaving your place
This road will lead me somewhere I don't really now
But it's somewhere someone always makes my day somehow
Let me go
Stop shouting, let me go
Let me go
Oh Baby let me go
