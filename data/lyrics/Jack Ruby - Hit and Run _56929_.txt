Hard love
When I'm on the street with you
Hard love
You know what I like to do

Teasing them with your heel
Freeze them with your name
Play with all the pretty boys
Send them up in flame

Cold chills
When you're dressed for fun
Cheap thrills
It's not for just anyone

Cruising to check the damage
After you get done
Making such sweet destruction
Playing hit and run

And you hit and you run
And you hit and you run
And you hit and you run
And you hit and you run
And you hit and you run
And you hit and you run
And you hit and you run
And you hit and you run
