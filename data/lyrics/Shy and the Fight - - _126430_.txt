Walkin' in the moonlight
Down those empty streets
It's here I wonder
If you're thinking of me
Lost and feeling lonely
'Cause you're worlds away
Time has no feeling
And I learn that each day
When one by one
The stars
They take away the sun
Once more
A lot that I can do is real
I said
(I can't fight the nights)
Without you
(I can't fight the nights)
There's no way
(I can't fight the nights)
Without You
I can't fight the nights
Can you hear me calling
I'm at the edge of the line
You got the power to save me
It's a matter of time
So I just keep on waiting
For a knock on my door
We can turn time around
To make love like before
'Cause In my heart
I know the stranger
In the dark
Is you
Your memory keeps haunting me
(I can't fight the nights)
Without you
(I can't fight the nights)
There's no way
(I can't fight the nights)
Without You
I can't fight the nights
(I can't fight the nights)
Without you
(I can't fight the nights)
There's no way
(I can't fight the nights)
Without You
I can't fight the nights
Well, if there were half a chance
To catch a moment with you
I'd lock it on forever
I won't let go
I can't let go
Let go of you....
When one by one
The stars
They take away the sun
Once more
A lot that I can do is real
I said
(I can't fight the nights)
Without you
(I can't fight the nights)
There's no way
(I can't fight the nights)
Without you
I can't fight the nights
(I can't fight the nights)
Without you
(I can't fight the nights)
There's no way
(I can't fight the nights)
Without you
