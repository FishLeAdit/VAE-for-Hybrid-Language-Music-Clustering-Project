Photographer friend, photographer friend
I’ll see you in the end
You ain’t like my other friends, you never judge
Picture’s worth a thousand words, it explains why we don’t talk
As we travel past the perfumed rows of hemlock trees
With one wheel in my hands and four more on the road
And you, you’re hanging out of the window
One days, we’ll be married to different people
And any stills you keep’ll keep us still until
You take the future and leave me with the past
Photographer friend, photographer friend
Some things they never last
You’ll see the future change the colour of the past
Photographer friend, Photographer friend
Some things they never last
