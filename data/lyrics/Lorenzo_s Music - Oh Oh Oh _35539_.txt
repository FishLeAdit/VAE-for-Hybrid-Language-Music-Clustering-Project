Comin' loose, not holding back
It's all everyone has left
Letting it out not letting it down
At least tonight
Hit it high for something more
Lose it all to lose everything
Give it all for free, though i already did
Tell me what happened
It could be better
Oh, oh, oh
Hit it high for something more
Lose it all to lose everything
Give it all for free, though i already did
Tell me what happened
It could be better
Oh, oh, oh
Come in 2 minutes, I've lost
Pearly whites and formal grab
It's been open its been had
It leaves you blind
Hit it high for something more
Lose it all to lose everything
Give it all for free, though i already did
Tell me what happened
It could be better
Oh, oh, oh
