Spider crawl across the wall
Doesn’t mean a thing at all
Spider crawl across the wall
Doesn’t mean a thing at all
Every step is soft and cruel
Like how the raindrops feel to the swimming pool
Thousand souls are left to greet
The thousand souls they'll never meet
Twist twist twist and fall
Voices down an empty hall
And in my living room
A lonely silver spoon
Doesn't move me
When at my desk alone
Dead speak from human bones
I hear you calling
Although your mouth is closed
It breaks my deeper bones and
Blows right through me
Blows right through me
Blows right through
Spider crawl across the wall
Doesn’t mean a thing at all
Spider crawl across the wall
Doesn’t mean a thing at all
At all, at all at all at all
At all, at all at all at all
