Animalia! Animalia! Animalia!
Animalia! Animalia! Animalia!
Animalia! Animalia! Animalia! Animalia!
Our cells are phospholipid membranous
Animalia! Animalia! Animalia! Animalia!
But have no form-restrictive containers
Animalia! Animalia! Animalia! Animalia!
Our high motility is what shapes us
For heterotrophy as predators
Chordata, annelids and ctenophores
Animalia!
The opisthokonta clade
Has become
The kingdoms of fungi
And animals
And animals
In the domain of eukaryota
ATP made inside mitochondria
But we contain no plastids like chloroplasts
With blastulae as diplo- or triploblasts
Kingdom of
Mollusca
Tardigrada
Arthropoda
Chordata:
The phylum of
Larvacia
Agnatha
Amphibia
And Mammalia:
Classis of
Rodentia
Cetacea
Carnivora
Primates:
The order of
Lemuridae
Tarsiidae
Atelidae
Hominidae:
Family of
Gorilla
And Pongo
Chimpanzee
And homo:
The genus of
Homo sapiens sapiens
(But we all came from before the Cambrian)
But we all came
But we all came
But we all came
But we all came
From a concestor in the Precambrian
Protostomes
(And deuter-
Ostomia)
With desmosomes
(Gap junctions, tight junctions)
And microtubules nucleated by centrosomes
Coelomates with hollow cores
Gastrulate from blastopores
And we chordates have tails and gill slits and notochords
Echinoderms
(Platyzoa, Nematoda)
And Arthropods
(Porifera and Cnidaria)
