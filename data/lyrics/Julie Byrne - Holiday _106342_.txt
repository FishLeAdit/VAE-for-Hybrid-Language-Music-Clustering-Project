We met on New Year's Eve in New York City
And how cold it had been then and soon would be again
We could’ve lived together
And given up our dreams of wandering
We could’ve left together
And given up our dreams of the home we could keep
And you, you may, you may travel alone
And be accompanied by my love
We parted by my birthday
And without you here, I am a different age
How bright I had been then
And fear that it may not ever show again
So continue to live alone
And speak not your thoughts of land or holiday
And I will leave again
And make all new plans to fill the space that you left
And I do, I do travel alone
And yours is not a number I can call on the phone
