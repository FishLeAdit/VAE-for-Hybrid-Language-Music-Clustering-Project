Lorado Taft directs a steely gaze
Down upon the plot of one Dexter Graves
There are no jumping spiders here
Ashtabula is long gone
Are you without a destination?
Have you finally found a home?
Center Ave leads further into the dark
Where Lawson's crusader stands
Although Lawson lies unmarked
You stand draped and hooded here
But I know who you are
Past the point of trepidation
Past the point of we are

Is this really happening?
Or is this just nothing at all?
I'm sorry I let you down
If I let you down before
'cause I feel nothing
And that's just what I felt before
I'm sorry I let you down
If I let you down before
I know I'll make it if I just keep on running
I know that daylight is fast approaching
There are girls and werewolves hot on my trail
There are willows and widows in funeral veils
