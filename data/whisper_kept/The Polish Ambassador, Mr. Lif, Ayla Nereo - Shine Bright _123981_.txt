Up from the sludge, up from the brine Free from the shackles, free from the barn Sightful the blind with some 8D glasses Extra dimensions, best of intentions That's not to mention Heights of ascension To those who would know the wrenching Gut wrenching, to think that we don't all wanna fly If you're standing in the former state's of mind, goodbye I see new horizons, yes the sun's rising So awe-inspiring, watch us just dive in Riving as we bask in the light, don't miss out This is your chance to shine bright You can see the birth of a life that lives on
