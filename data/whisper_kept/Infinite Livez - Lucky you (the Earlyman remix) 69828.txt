Yo, yo, like fables, similar to Aesop When it comes to eavesdropping on the truth And the way you do it, no proof In floods on improper hill disappear like boots In a cloud, big up your chest and feel proud For the things that you've done I'ma tell your sister, I'ma tell your daughter, I'ma tell your son Continuation of my lyrical family tree Everybody that is surrounding me Down with me and thus my ancestors Is interesting with the rest of my life
