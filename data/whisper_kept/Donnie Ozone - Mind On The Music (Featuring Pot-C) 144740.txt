I got my mind on the music, I got my mind on the music and you're a little bit stronger Now listen to the LZ, you're a rocker for June Guaranteed I'm the George Zimmer promise You put on a beat, I'll come rock in pajamas Honest to goodness, anytime, anyplace The words out my mouth, putting smiles on your face Four miles late to waste, cause I gave them a taste Erase and replace all the rhymes in my space The time I bomb takes, my lines don't escape Just bounce in your brain, asleep and awake I creep in and make dirty dishes and laundry No cheap tricks, I don't want you to want me Rock-
