What up, Lovett? You ready to keep this thing running? You ready? Fuck it, I'ma take it like a relay The line's on the track, you think I'm running on the freeway In a great truck, never get the brakes pumped You think my kicks are on dust, cause they laced up Like I ain't running straight, actually I'm running late You can call me the vice-pres, I'm your running mate I go from 1 to 8 or 9 to 5 and back to 9 That's why I'm running up this mountain that I have to climb To the summit, you did it, then I've done it The game's over, I'm running late I'm running late, I'm running late I'm running late, I'm running late, I'm running late
