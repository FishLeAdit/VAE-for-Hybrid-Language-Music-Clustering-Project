You're lost, like all these dreams, are growing moss. I see moonbeams, they're going off, they're cutting loose. And showing off, deep in the dark, they're going nuts. Terror attacks, below it cuts, horrible hands. Have thrown a dart, look at your life, you're blown apart. 2009, nowhere to hide, to put it straight, I'm terrified. Cause once something affects my heart, it always seems.
