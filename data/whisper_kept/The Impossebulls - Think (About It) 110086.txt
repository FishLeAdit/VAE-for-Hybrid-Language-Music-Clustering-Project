What if I could kick it with more lungs tuned? What if cigarettes stopped calming me down? What if mic skills were more commonly found? What if music was original, beats all visual? What if I'm unique, one in a trillion individual? What if residuals could pay for my songs? What if I had time to just play with a dog? I'm saying you're playing along to my rant. Shit, if my uncle had Tetsy be my aunt. Think about it. Huh? What? No. Think about it.
