Picture me rollin' like that pop movie that's comin' soon Remember me as a titan, nigga I'm like Coach Bo All eyes on me, I'm catchin' passes, no Perifio I know the dots flow, but my shit hit like Griffy though Only bars over here, I don't fuck with any Xanis The man's biggest leaders, they wearin' panties just to get a Grammy Niggas ain't talkin' about a revolution I'm in it for the love, I just want some evolution No retribution in my soul, I'm on the reservoir
