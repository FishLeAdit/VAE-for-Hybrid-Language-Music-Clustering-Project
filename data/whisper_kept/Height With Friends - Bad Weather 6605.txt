We can take this pick, so adjust the shutter speeds and exposure times. I got enough of what I need to explode your lines into dust, into space. When I bust in your place, I see trash on the ground and no rust in your face. Tight as raw when he speaks, leave your wall full of leaks. We can walk on the roofs, grabbing the hawks by the beaks. These half-hearted sneaks are getting caught in the dark lights. My shock raps pop back right when the clock strikes the rhyme.
