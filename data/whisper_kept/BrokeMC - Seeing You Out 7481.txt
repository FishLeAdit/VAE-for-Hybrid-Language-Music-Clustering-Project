Lost control. Whatever it is that you believe you're seeing, it's not, not, not, not real. Seeing things before they happen. Things are not always what they seem in this place. So you can't take anything for granted. I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plagued my life here. When I stop going, I will be well, be well, be, be, be, well. Are you also that virgin friend?
