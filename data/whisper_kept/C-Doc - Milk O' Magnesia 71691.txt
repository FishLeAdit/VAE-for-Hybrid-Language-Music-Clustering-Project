Kick your feet up with something that'll ease ya Now you're stuck, I've been looking back easy Old people drive slow and tip shitty Rollin' in the hover-round chair, sittin' pretty So throw a motherfucker some bucks for bills So I don't have to contribute to society's ills By robin' old folks You see how the circle goes Eatin' fruit world because I can't afford Cheerios I know you know all that sugar makes you buggy Mountin' off the walls like you're snowin' up the druggies Smackin' boy on some back-galley shit Grabbin' on dick Hanging with Andy Dick
