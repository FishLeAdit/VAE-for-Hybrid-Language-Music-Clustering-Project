Let me your Brooklyn bells, you'll ring old Goodman out of the sea before I wed one else. And old Goodman's farm is ranks, he's sand and was this thousand year. But it shall turn to rich plough land before I change my dear. And old Fairfield Church is water bound from autumn to the spring. But it shall turn to oil ground before I change my dear.
