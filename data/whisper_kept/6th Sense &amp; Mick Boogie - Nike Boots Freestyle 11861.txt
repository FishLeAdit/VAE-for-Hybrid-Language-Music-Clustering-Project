Here's a couple sizes, I think they might suit ya You mighta seen them on me last week down at Sutra Rest in peace, the big impact, they never found a shooter The six senses here, yeah, he's the sound of future I love the butter tooth songs like the brown and fuchsia Check me at the bar with another round of shooters I mean a round of shots, getting chopped with my bros Still I keep it fresh like the socks in my toes So there's no crease, cause there's no peace I let the voice say it again
