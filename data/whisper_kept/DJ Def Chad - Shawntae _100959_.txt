Now is it wrong to be intimate on the first night? Yo I guess cause she started shitting tears on my chest And the motion stopped before I met my climax I asked her what's wrong, she said you know this is wrong I'm not your hood, right I said I'm strapped with my gym hat Wrong words, with no hesitation started putting on her clothes Hitted to the front door, she said I'm not your whore Now why am I feeling this way? I'm used to playing tricks like a mac carton sending them on their way But still I'm not your hood, right I said I'm not your hood, right I said I'm not your whore
