Hey, the hole behind CM, you're fine Looking like a million bucks I'm not sure why you're hanging with a bunch of smucks You need to put your boots on it Keep on moving, go see the world, see all this beauty Sunday morning cruising, meet you on the other side Let me know what the deal is, man, I'm trying to ride A star like you, need a place where you can shine bright Where people won't hate, but embrace that light, come on Somebody answer to the call
