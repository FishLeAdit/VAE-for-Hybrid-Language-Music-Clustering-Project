I'm giving you my all, it's time to pay the price I think about you every day, we're playing by the night Want the best of both worlds, you could call me selfish Down in all this liquor, waking up and feeling helpless I mean, we both have things that we couldn't take Try to visualize a picture that we couldn't paint You want another part of me that I couldn't change So it's only right, we both go on a separate ways, I'm saying I'm still doing guys And you want me to be right I can be the light
