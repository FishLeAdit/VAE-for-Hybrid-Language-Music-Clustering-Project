I'm only one, where everything's sad and done, so you can see what you've become. Past and obsession, passive aggression, but sleep and arrest it when I'm trapped in a session. I'm investing every dollar in it, they're screaming and they're hollering. I wonder why I'm bothering to get this little following. But swallowing the truth is harder than a bottle, and hopefully the sun still comes out tomorrow. When I wallow in self-sorrow, I roll a couple minutes, let her love me for a second.
