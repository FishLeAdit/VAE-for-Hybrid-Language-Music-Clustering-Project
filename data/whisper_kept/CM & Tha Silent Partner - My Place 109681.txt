I don't drink a smoke, that doesn't ruin the night Yeah, you can call me square, me, I just call me rare So what can I call you besides beautiful? I know you got a name or maybe an alias If you're feeling kinda strange and you still don't trust me Yes, I must admit that my skills are quite rusty Haven't entertained a new female in some time We could dive into a convo, I really don't mind Shept a little bout me, learn a little bout you Look at the time, let me know what you wanna do With no rush
