Son, Zoo Robert Green, 48 all the war 50 is, shift is, slow down grimy Humble before rumble yet you still don't wanna try me The eyes beat, the window to the soul Used to be Mr. Nice Guy but nice guy is getting old No doubt, all that BS is played out You at me, I match you to one of us is laid out Yo I give you two reps and hope that you take note of it Know that it's no possible way that I won't blow up I'm loaded in shock, cock at the aim and I'm so focused Ferocious and not watch that tame it, I'm going globalize Keep on my live episodes, it's not my way to go
