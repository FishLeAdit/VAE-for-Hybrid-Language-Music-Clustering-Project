We are again We were here I don't seem to remember when Back to this planet This time it seems we planned it My friend I'd like to restart the race and the betting Would you put all your money on me? Forgetting if there wasn't a game or a winner Would you still wanna know what I see? The memory never seems to want to let us feel And suddenly the memory is just what's said
