You know, he brought that record home. Peace of mind, he brought that home. He brought home Diary of a Madman, Blizzard of Oz. And I just remember just loving this music. Judas Priest, Screaming for Vengeance. I was just blown away by this stuff, man. And, you know, I was into that. I was into stuff like Twisted Sister, like around 7th grade, Stay Hungry. That album rules, man. And, you know, I can remember my brother being a big Wasp fan.
