Roaches, roaches, a million roaches, starts to wake up when night. Roaches, see so many feel claustrophobic, since my home city's filled up with roaches. If someone doesn't take a shiny shoe and crush him, I'll grab a small box, then I'll catch him and flush him. A crowd of co-workers cheer, get him, get him, and once he's in the box, my boss will say, bet him. At home, at home, at home.
