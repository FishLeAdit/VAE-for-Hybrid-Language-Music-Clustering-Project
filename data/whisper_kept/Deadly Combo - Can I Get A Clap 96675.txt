You would've dead and come up with me like, buy what I can Y'all lift the fuse in the can Now you're acting like you ain't supposed to do what we're doing Let's get it straight and put a shoe in Watch the rest come found And do tomorrow out to separate your head from your neck Let's leave me holla Y'all we back on the scene Doing what we do best Let's put in there some wild shit out to make you lose it Don't you get confused, kid Get me coming on the track Giving them this music, so can we get it? Can we get it? Can we get it? Can we get it? Can we get it? Can we get it?
