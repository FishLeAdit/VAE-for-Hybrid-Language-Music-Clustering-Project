Back door back on the loose Somebody's gonna snack on the back of my boots Matter of fact, I'm smacked and I'm looped Gangsta shit like I've been rapping with Snoop Half of the loot is going into my pocket The other half's fed, blasting off in a rocket Now that we're talking, your dealer is whack Can't tell if I wanna make a dealer attack I'll take a meal and a sack and a bottle of Jack Getting pissed off, need to swallow it back The throttle is jacked and the tires are spinning Social war, jerks and liars are winning
