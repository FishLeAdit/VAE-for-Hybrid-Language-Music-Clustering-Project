Always out of arms reach, always a white house touch. Here, sitting through a horse and here, and less there. Always looking for these even more comfortable positions. Less there, and always settling into a rock and weary. Again, still in the way weary. Again, shunned into a white house, and one caverns, and all of the rocks, and one caverns, and vast chains, and vast chains, and vast chains, and vast chains, and vast chains, and down, and the other side, and down, and through the earth, and through the earth, and through the earth, lots of oil, thick vapor, great.
