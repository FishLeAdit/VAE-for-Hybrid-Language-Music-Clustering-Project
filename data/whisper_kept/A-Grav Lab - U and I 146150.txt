Yo, I could kiss like Kathie Lee after she found that break was cheating Plain to see when you show your true colors I'd hate to be in your position Where no one listens But once you notice this It's over with I go to spit On your tombstone when time passes And notice the AG logo rotating on fine plastics on wheels Internationally Then I smash an MC Who wants video hits And to speak fashionably Rather than think rationally They wanna jump off the deep end And weaken hip-hop's unification I'm soon to be breaking the mold I'm soon to be breaking the mold
