So I've made four to date. Two of them I've already given away. And Lord knows what's going to happen to the other two. Most of them have three strings, of course. There's one experimental dulcimer which I made has six strings there in pairs of a heavy and a light string, which gives it a very strange sound, like a 12-string guitar if you're familiar with them. What were your friends' names that do like you?
