But y'all expected me to say, who don't find X? Impossible's, that's my motherfucking word. Straight to the front of the ever-loving herd. Times are tough, most of the world is living rough. Even some rich people now living on the curve. The end to a mean means the world's about to end. Living on borrowed time, all of mankind. You can look to the sky, search for a sign. But my greatest power comes from my own mind. The daily grind is trying to survive. Everywhere I see trolls, like I'm living in a hive. Like chill rough, it's getting down.
