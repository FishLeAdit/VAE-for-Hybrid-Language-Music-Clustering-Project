Take your name and become nameless When you step you move the statement Not a sprint, go to marathon Night to the break of dawn The glory won't be televised Reproduced from the highest high highs But in the half empty dives Every sound they'll be clapping Every demon they'll be moving From their feet to the footnotes Until the book's turning And we wondered what this moment was Was it a dream? Was it a nightmare?
