I got cards in my spokes so my tires can't clack Take your feet off the belts, leave you 8 miles back This ain't a marathon like the Tour de France And I got two balls so I must not be Lance I'm strong, but legs are strong too It pretty much explains why I'm faster than you Getting dirty looks when people do not like Me running over dogs with my DMX bike Ride my bike round the street real fast See a fat bitch start to laugh
