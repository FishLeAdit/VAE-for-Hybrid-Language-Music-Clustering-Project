Up from the sludge, up from the brine Free from the shackles, free from the bind Sight for the blind with some 8D glasses Extra dimensions, best of intentions Best not to mention heights of ascension To those who would know the wrenching Gut wrenching to think that we don't all wanna fly If you're staying in the former states of mind, goodbye I see new horizons, yes the sun's rising So awe-inspiring, watch us just dive in Thriving as we bask in the light Don't miss out, this is your chance to shine bright We can see the birth of the life that lives on
