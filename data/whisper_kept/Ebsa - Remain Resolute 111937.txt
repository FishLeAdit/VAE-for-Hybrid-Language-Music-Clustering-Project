I'm crazy, yeah baby, certain motherfuckers wanna play me The times I feel lonely in this big wide world When all I got is my mind, body and soul I see bad mind people and the attitude stinks You wanna bully me, you better motherfucking think again And get your head right, cause at the end of the day It's just another dark night So don't put me in the corner cause I'm liable to skip I'm just an animal with survival instincts I'm just an animal with survival instincts
