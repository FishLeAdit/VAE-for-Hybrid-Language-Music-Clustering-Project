I'm pressed on the brain to maintain the same thing So I try not to change, but that claim is insane Don't exchange it in vain when it's all rearranged Always me, never will I change the game Ain't the same, who can I blame? Is it me insane in the membrane? Gotta maintain, that's on everything I'ma make the eardrums ring Trumpet sounds, that's the sound that I bring Listen false prophets, I done came down Open clouds, no rain now Gotta fight the power now, never break me down I'm the twin towers now, never throw in the towel Second time I'm gonna make the eardrums ring
