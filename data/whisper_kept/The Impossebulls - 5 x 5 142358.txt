One, two, three, four, five, and we live! One to the two to the three to the four We give you five minutes and we're breaking down your door In the morning like the cops when it's 6am In the next seven seconds I'ma hit you again And maybe eight was enough back in the old prime time But when the bulls start running we bring in the whole nine It was ten years and coming on that lowdown track Turn the volume to eleven and you better get back Grab the twelve inch wax, now we're swinging the axe Like Friday the thirteenth
