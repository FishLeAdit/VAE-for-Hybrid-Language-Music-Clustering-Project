Gonna be somebody with the blues from Cobain To that dude down the lane For some the drumbeat won't compete or sustain And those fin to check might cause upset Still the world remains nasty No matter who past you Staying classy up to date with the circus Things that make you go hmmm Contemplate the purpose Not to say I'm jumping ship Just some flows on flip I reminisce over those who got swept off the toes Drawn to a close so if it's cons to the pros Think it over long before you quit to ring the gong A new date, a new perspective
