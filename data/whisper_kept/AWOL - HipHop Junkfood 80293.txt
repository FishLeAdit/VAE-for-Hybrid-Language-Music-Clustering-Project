My best coach, they looking dimmed out, but inside they ugly on the low though Brown bomb, I'm nice and smooth on the promo This is Union Records for the 2000 Oak Choke I'm a hip-hop junkie at heart Still digging, still sampling the funkiest parts Still grinding for the money to start Cause rock is on your radio, nothing but darts Off the top for AB, I love this But I'm not stuck in 9-3, I want it all Soon they'll sign to me, I'm something else But it's not something I'm trying to be A way of life, and I never ask why me I'm not stuck in 9-3
