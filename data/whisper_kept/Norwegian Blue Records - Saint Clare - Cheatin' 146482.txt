For goodness sake, put a ring on it with me For goodness sake, and she says Don't you lie to me I wanna know the truth of my death About you, about you, about you So it falls all the confusion Now you know I love you and I never miss you And I ain't got no mess But I'm the only place Just falling on my knees Begging you better to please me So it falls all the confusion
