Sight, oil, steel, step back is tight Not giving a fuck about the poor's plight Or who they indict A third in jail each and every night Prison industry, modern day slavery Corporations on lock and key Big brother, he be watching me Only pillage gets a doozy If you're lucky and you're white male Then you get to be free This is revolutionary music And you should like it and you should choose it A lot of powers that be will misuse it
