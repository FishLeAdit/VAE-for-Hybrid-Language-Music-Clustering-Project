Picture me rolling like that Pac movie that's coming soon Remember me as a titan, nigga I'm like Coach Bo All eyes on me, I'm catching passes, no peripheral An orthodox flow, but my shit hit like Griffey though Only bars over here, I don't fuck with any Zannies The manliest leaders, they wearing panties just to get a Grammy Niggas ain't talking about a revolution I'm in it for the love, I just want some evolution No retribution in my soul, I'm on the resolution
