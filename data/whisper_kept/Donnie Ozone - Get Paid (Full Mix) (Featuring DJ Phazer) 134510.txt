No business, run drugs or guns Play Bonnie and Clyde, have all the fun Avoid paying taxes, keep all the funds Be your very own boss, answer to no one Until the feds notice when it comes undone Risk your freedom in your life, now you're on the run They say that you choose fast money and greed But it's the only reason you're not living in the streets Now you can go astray and you can make a way Cause you have the rent and the bills to pay You can wake up early with my heart everyday
