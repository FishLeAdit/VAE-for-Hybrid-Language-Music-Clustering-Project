The critical mass people are in the car. And the problem is I'm not sure that you can come up with a solution that's good for both sides. There are other ways to accomplish this than staging it. A bicycle demonstration on the edge of peak commuter hours in the most busiest section of the city. That's counterproductive and antagonistic. We want to get activated. We want to get mobilized as Christians. I mean, instead of just standing here and wringing our hands over a problem like this, friends, what can we do?
