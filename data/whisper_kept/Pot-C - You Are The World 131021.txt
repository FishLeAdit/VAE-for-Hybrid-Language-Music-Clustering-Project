This and that or who's shoes should provide for those you chose to bring with you The back of your mind wonders what's gonna hit you The Z's, the trees, the C's, the B's Are not paying attention to the SUV's Coming around the mountain riding six white horses When she comes with the papers to file the faucets A never-ending story that's mine It's a tray you put in upright position Taking Falcon on a mission Telling anyone who'll listen that the galaxy center Is right in your noggin, the palace we enter Can't be built, the beans are all spilt You wanna move up and this world gets stilt It's the SimCity Matrix, the oysterless pearl
