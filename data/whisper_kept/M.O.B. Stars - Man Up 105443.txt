Like Nikki Roman and her personalities Are y'all niggas getting capped like a New Jersey teacher's salary? Caught up in the penitentiary, tossing some jail nigga salad, B Getting worked out in that 8-5-10 just like a calorie Depicting how the realists live, but You the lesson on fallacy, and reality masquerading is your mastery Actually you's a vagotent You always on your back like you in a perpetual casket But death is something you could never imagine Now, I ain't wanna make threats, this is a cautionary tale These streets will swallow you the fuck up, and it hardly ever fails Who the fuck am I to say? Born in a church, strayed from the streets And you listening to me spit?
