Not God. Sacrifice to a high priest offering at the altar. Read from the book of I Ching after they killed the author. Slept with the king's daughter. Preservation of bloodline. Drunk wine from a gold cup holding the holy water. Just imagine the thought of seeing the unseen. Knowing the unknown. A dream and the untreamed. There's 99 lodges fueled by one thing. Domination of everything ruled by one king. Some believe in the afterlife. Heaven or purgatory. But no one is coming back to life. That's the passion I have for Christ. But I've been murdered. I've been deceased and rebirthed. Seeing first and the second.
