Moving down to town, life is just a journey. I'm looking for a place to call home. I know that I'm bound to find what I'm after. I'm looking for a place. I'm looking for a place. I'm looking for a place to call home. Home is just a place where you can lay your head. But I'm looking for a place to call home.
