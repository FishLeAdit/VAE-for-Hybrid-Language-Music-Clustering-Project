Makers and potters, back to the origins of our fathers and freedoms Not legions but tribes, not heathens but scribes Not seamens but wives of the universe In a soothing verse, they will undo the curse They will unveil the nurse, that ours message is new Not of ending, but of proof that we are the attending who recoup All the lost in the groove, those pushed down by untruth Those who haven't gotten what they're due This song right here, well, this one's for you And it's alright, and it's fine
