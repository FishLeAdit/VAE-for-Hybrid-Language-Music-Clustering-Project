When you go to sleep, I like to lie upon your chest Listening to your breathing When you laugh aloud, I like to think that you have guessed Oh, you have worked me out From the inside, like a piece of plastic steam Back to my face on your mantelpiece Keep me there, keep me dusted, oh, keep me sweet And I'll come and die Even though it isn't true
