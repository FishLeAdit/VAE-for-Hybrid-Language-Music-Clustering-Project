Like the flame, you're the starter Play the victim, you martyr Everyone's dumb and you're smart But now it's on you, love street, no team You try to mend but bust out the seam There's nothing left no one can redeem All in your head, thoughts won't set you free Hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
