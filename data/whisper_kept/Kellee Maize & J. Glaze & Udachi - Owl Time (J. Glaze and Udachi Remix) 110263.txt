I said I'll tell you how I lost my mind and then I got it back with a soul clap And I on burn the incense, break the drones out, don't get on the phone, swear the word, get in the zone Cause birds of a feather can't go through any weather and I think it better If we unite the tribe and do this forever, ah, stack a little cheddar, eat it all together Make a new gift to kind of me, then forget about the past, rewrite, think faster, put this track On blast, on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-blast, on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-blast, on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-blast On-on-on-on-on-on-on-on Where my ow's at, where my gow's at, into the fellas I'm gonna pound that, I think it's down
