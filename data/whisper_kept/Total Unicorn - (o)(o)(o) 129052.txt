Keep breathing in. You should still be breathing in. As the air continues to inflate your lungs, imagine that you're a big balloon. You should be quite full of air now, and starting to float around the room. Keep breathing in, it's the only way you'll keep floating at this point. Have your roommate or significant other or neighbor or postman open the door, and float out into the yard.
