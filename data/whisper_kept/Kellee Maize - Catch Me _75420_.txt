Strong time to connect But really was under all that light I might need to look much deeper Forget my creeper, but what's your current status Are you happy with the past and the future? Oh really it doesn't matter I could be living in this moment with you Saying goodbye to my mental chatter And respecting the new Trusting the universe I am Earth's far from curse It will be worth the work You could be heaven and I the Earth I figure you're even gonna make me write a third verse
