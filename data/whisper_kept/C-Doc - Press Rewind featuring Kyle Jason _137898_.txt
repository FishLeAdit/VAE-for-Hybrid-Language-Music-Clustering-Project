I try to compose myself after summer sun sets And I notice you slaying back, said notice the sweat Drippin' down your brow, comin' sugar sugar let me show ya how I take it back to yesterday I see your eyes talkin' and I hear the words you say Eyes talkin' and I hear the words they say Today is yesterday Let's do it again, baby said yesterday Two such lovely days Said let's kick back, ooh Let's do it again
