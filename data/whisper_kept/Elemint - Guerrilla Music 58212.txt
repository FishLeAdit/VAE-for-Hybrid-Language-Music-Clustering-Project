Ourselves, home by myself, feeling like I'm locked in a cell Mind trapped in this box, watching what they trying to sell Not buying in, or denying that we out for ourselves Marginalized by large enterprises, targets of lies And bargains made to clog up your eyes Carving the time slots, minds right Making it hard to decide who's on my side Lies sewn, woven into our eyes Lives are being stolen and no one's making it right A systematic isolation control Whole population, Joe, this nation is sold Out from under our nose, it's no wonder So many police, I patrol in my street
