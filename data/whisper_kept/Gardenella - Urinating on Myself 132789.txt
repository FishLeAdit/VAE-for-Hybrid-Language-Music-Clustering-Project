In its ready corner, chosen place to die. We die alone, we live alone, on the phone. Speeding car, remote control. So many minutes, an abundance. Costs less than I have, $2.50, $1? I don't know, but I care about my car. Little blue thing with a weaker honk than a bicycle horn, 30 years young. Little blue thing in my dreams. Speed around, no effort, or gas hardly. Simplicity in a light blue way, with a gang sign painted from the sun. Backward turning pages, urinating in mice.
